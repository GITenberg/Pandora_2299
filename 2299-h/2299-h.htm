<h1>PANDORA<br />
by Henry James</h1>
<h2>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has long been the custom of the
North German Lloyd steamers, which convey passengers from Bremen
to New York, to anchor for several hours in the pleasant port of
Southampton, where their human cargo receives many
additions.&nbsp; An intelligent young German, Count Otto
Vogelstein, hardly knew a few years ago whether to condemn this
custom or approve it.&nbsp; He leaned over the bulwarks of the
<i>Donau</i> as the American passengers crossed the
plank&mdash;the travellers who embark at Southampton are mainly
of that nationality&mdash;and curiously, indifferently, vaguely,
through the smoke of his cigar, saw them absorbed in the huge
capacity of the ship, where he had the agreeable consciousness
that his own nest was comfortably made.&nbsp; To watch from such
a point of vantage the struggles of those less fortunate than
ourselves&mdash;of the uninformed, the unprovided, the belated,
the bewildered&mdash;is an occupation not devoid of sweetness,
and there was nothing to mitigate the complacency with which our
young friend gave himself up to it; nothing, that is, save a
natural benevolence which had not yet been extinguished by the
consciousness of official greatness.&nbsp; For Count Vogelstein
was official, as I think you would have seen from the
straightness of his back, the lustre of his light elegant
spectacles, and something discreet and diplomatic in the curve of
his moustache, which looked as if it might well contribute to the
principal function, as cynics say, of the lips&mdash;the active
concealment of thought.&nbsp; He had been appointed to the
secretaryship of the German legation at Washington and in these
first days of the autumn was about to take possession of his
post.&nbsp; He was a model character for such a
purpose&mdash;serious civil ceremonious curious stiff, stuffed
with knowledge and convinced that, as lately rearranged, the
German Empire places in the most striking light the highest of
all the possibilities of the greatest of all the peoples.&nbsp;
He was quite aware, however, of the claims to economic and other
consideration of the United States, and that this quarter of the
globe offered a vast field for study.</p>
<p>The process of inquiry had already begun for him, in spite of
his having as yet spoken to none of his fellow-passengers; the
case being that Vogelstein inquired not only with his tongue, but
with his eyes&mdash;that is with his spectacles&mdash;with his
ears, with his nose, with his palate, with all his senses and
organs.&nbsp; He was a highly upright young man, whose only fault
was that his sense of comedy, or of the humour of things, had
never been specifically disengaged from his several other
senses.&nbsp; He vaguely felt that something should be done about
this, and in a general manner proposed to do it, for he was on
his way to explore a society abounding in comic aspects.&nbsp;
This consciousness of a missing measure gave him a certain
mistrust of what might be said of him; and if circumspection is
the essence of diplomacy our young aspirant promised well.&nbsp;
His mind contained several millions of facts, packed too closely
together for the light breeze of the imagination to draw through
the mass.&nbsp; He was impatient to report himself to his
superior in Washington, and the loss of time in an English port
could only incommode him, inasmuch as the study of English
institutions was no part of his mission.&nbsp; On the other hand
the day was charming; the blue sea, in Southampton Water, pricked
all over with light, had no movement but that of its infinite
shimmer.&nbsp; Moreover he was by no means sure that he should be
happy in the United States, where doubtless he should find
himself soon enough disembarked.&nbsp; He knew that this was not
an important question and that happiness was an unscientific
term, such as a man of his education should be ashamed to use
even in the silence of his thoughts.&nbsp; Lost none the less in
the inconsiderate crowd and feeling himself neither in his own
country nor in that to which he was in a manner accredited, he
was reduced to his mere personality; so that during the hour, to
save his importance, he cultivated such ground as lay in sight
for a judgement of this delay to which the German steamer was
subjected in English waters.&nbsp; Mightn&rsquo;t it be proved,
facts, figures and documents&mdash;or at least watch&mdash;in
hand, considerably greater than the occasion demanded?</p>
<p>Count Vogelstein was still young enough in diplomacy to think
it necessary to have opinions.&nbsp; He had a good many indeed
which had been formed without difficulty; they had been received
ready-made from a line of ancestors who knew what they
liked.&nbsp; This was of course&mdash;and under pressure, being
candid, he would have admitted it&mdash;an unscientific way of
furnishing one&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Our young man was a stiff
conservative, a Junker of Junkers; he thought modern democracy a
temporary phase and expected to find many arguments against it in
the great Republic.&nbsp; In regard to these things it was a
pleasure to him to feel that, with his complete training, he had
been taught thoroughly to appreciate the nature of
evidence.&nbsp; The ship was heavily laden with German emigrants,
whose mission in the United States differed considerably from
Count Otto&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They hung over the bulwarks, densely
grouped; they leaned forward on their elbows for hours, their
shoulders kept on a level with their ears; the men in furred
caps, smoking long-bowled pipes, the women with babies hidden in
remarkably ugly shawls.&nbsp; Some were yellow Germans and some
were black, and all looked greasy and matted with the
sea-damp.&nbsp; They were destined to swell still further the
huge current of the Western democracy; and Count Vogelstein
doubtless said to himself that they wouldn&rsquo;t improve its
quality.&nbsp; Their numbers, however, were striking, and I know
not what he thought of the nature of this particular
evidence.</p>
<p>The passengers who came on board at Southampton were not of
the greasy class; they were for the most part American families
who had been spending the summer, or a longer period, in
Europe.&nbsp; They had a great deal of luggage, innumerable bags
and rugs and hampers and sea-chairs, and were composed largely of
ladies of various ages, a little pale with anticipation, wrapped
also in striped shawls, though in prettier ones than the nursing
mothers of the steerage, and crowned with very high hats and
feathers.&nbsp; They darted to and fro across the gangway,
looking for each other and for their scattered parcels; they
separated and reunited, they exclaimed and declared, they eyed
with dismay the occupants of the forward quarter, who seemed
numerous enough to sink the vessel, and their voices sounded
faint and far as they rose to Vogelstein&rsquo;s ear over the
latter&rsquo;s great tarred sides.&nbsp; He noticed that in the
new contingent there were many young girls, and he remembered
what a lady in Dresden had once said to him&mdash;that America
was the country of the M&auml;dchen.&nbsp; He wondered whether he
should like that, and reflected that it would be an aspect to
study, like everything else.&nbsp; He had known in Dresden an
American family in which there were three daughters who used to
skate with the officers, and some of the ladies now coming on
board struck him as of that same habit, except that in the
Dresden days feathers weren&rsquo;t worn quite so high.</p>
<p>At last the ship began to creak and slowly bridge, and the
delay at Southampton came to an end.&nbsp; The gangway was
removed and the vessel indulged in the awkward evolutions that
were to detach her from the land.&nbsp; Count Vogelstein had
finished his cigar, and he spent a long time in walking up and
down the upper deck.&nbsp; The charming English coast passed
before him, and he felt this to be the last of the old
world.&nbsp; The American coast also might be pretty&mdash;he
hardly knew what one would expect of an American coast; but he
was sure it would be different.&nbsp; Differences, however, were
notoriously half the charm of travel, and perhaps even most when
they couldn&rsquo;t be expressed in figures, numbers, diagrams or
the other merely useful symbols.&nbsp; As yet indeed there were
very few among the objects presented to sight on the
steamer.&nbsp; Most of his fellow-passengers appeared of one and
the same persuasion, and that persuasion the least to be
mistaken.&nbsp; They were Jews and commercial to a man.&nbsp; And
by this time they had lighted their cigars and put on all manner
of seafaring caps, some of them with big ear-lappets which
somehow had the effect of bringing out their peculiar facial
type.&nbsp; At last the new voyagers began to emerge from below
and to look about them, vaguely, with that suspicious expression
of face always to be noted in the newly embarked and which, as
directed to the receding land, resembles that of a person who
begins to perceive himself the victim of a trick.&nbsp; Earth and
ocean, in such glances, are made the subject of a sweeping
objection, and many travellers, in the general plight, have an
air at once duped and superior, which seems to say that they
could easily go ashore if they would.</p>
<p>It still wanted two hours of dinner, and by the time
Vogelstein&rsquo;s long legs had measured three or four miles on
the deck he was ready to settle himself in his sea-chair and draw
from his pocket a Tauchnitz novel by an American author whose
pages, he had been assured, would help to prepare him for some of
the oddities.&nbsp; On the back of his chair his name was painted
in rather large letters, this being a precaution taken at the
recommendation of a friend who had told him that on the American
steamers the passengers&mdash;especially the ladies&mdash;thought
nothing of pilfering one&rsquo;s little comforts.&nbsp; His
friend had even hinted at the correct reproduction of his
coronet.&nbsp; This marked man of the world had added that the
Americans are greatly impressed by a coronet.&nbsp; I know not
whether it was scepticism or modesty, but Count Vogelstein had
omitted every pictured plea for his rank; there were others of
which he might have made use.&nbsp; The precious piece of
furniture which on the Atlantic voyage is trusted never to flinch
among universal concussions was emblazoned simply with his title
and name.&nbsp; It happened, however, that the blazonry was huge;
the back of the chair was covered with enormous German
characters.&nbsp; This time there can be no doubt: it was modesty
that caused the secretary of legation, in placing himself, to
turn this portion of his seat outward, away from the eyes of his
companions&mdash;to present it to the balustrade of the
deck.&nbsp; The ship was passing the Needles&mdash;the beautiful
uttermost point of the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; Certain tall white
cones of rock rose out of the purple sea; they flushed in the
afternoon light and their vague rosiness gave them a human
expression in face of the cold expanse toward which the prow was
turned; they seemed to say farewell, to be the last note of a
peopled world.&nbsp; Vogelstein saw them very comfortably from
his place and after a while turned his eyes to the other quarter,
where the elements of air and water managed to make between them
so comparatively poor an opposition.&nbsp; Even his American
novelist was more amusing than that, and he prepared to return to
this author.&nbsp; In the great curve which it described,
however, his glance was arrested by the figure of a young lady
who had just ascended to the deck and who paused at the mouth of
the companionway.</p>
<p>This was not in itself an extraordinary phenomenon; but what
attracted Vogelstein&rsquo;s attention was the fact that the
young person appeared to have fixed her eyes on him.&nbsp; She
was slim, brightly dressed, rather pretty; Vogelstein remembered
in a moment that he had noticed her among the people on the wharf
at Southampton.&nbsp; She was soon aware he had observed her;
whereupon she began to move along the deck with a step that
seemed to indicate a purpose of approaching him.&nbsp; Vogelstein
had time to wonder whether she could be one of the girls he had
known at Dresden; but he presently reflected that they would now
be much older than that.&nbsp; It was true they were apt to
advance, like this one, straight upon their victim.&nbsp; Yet the
present specimen was no longer looking at him, and though she
passed near him it was now tolerably clear she had come above but
to take a general survey.&nbsp; She was a quick handsome
competent girl, and she simply wanted to see what one could think
of the ship, of the weather, of the appearance of England, from
such a position as that; possibly even of one&rsquo;s
fellow-passengers.&nbsp; She satisfied herself promptly on these
points, and then she looked about, while she walked, as if in
keen search of a missing object; so that Vogelstein finally
arrived at a conviction of her real motive.&nbsp; She passed near
him again and this time almost stopped, her eyes bent upon him
attentively.&nbsp; He thought her conduct remarkable even after
he had gathered that it was not at his face, with its yellow
moustache, she was looking, but at the chair on which he was
seated.&nbsp; Then those words of his friend came back to
him&mdash;the speech about the tendency of the people, especially
of the ladies, on the American steamers to take to themselves
one&rsquo;s little belongings.&nbsp; Especially the ladies, he
might well say; for here was one who apparently wished to pull
from under him the very chair he was sitting on.&nbsp; He was
afraid she would ask him for it, so he pretended to read,
systematically avoiding her eye.&nbsp; He was conscious she
hovered near him, and was moreover curious to see what she would
do.&nbsp; It seemed to him strange that such a nice-looking
girl&mdash;for her appearance was really charming&mdash;should
endeavour by arts so flagrant to work upon the quiet dignity of a
secretary of legation.&nbsp; At last it stood out that she was
trying to look round a corner, as it were&mdash;trying to see
what was written on the back of his chair.&nbsp; &ldquo;She wants
to find out my name; she wants to see who I am!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
reflexion passed through his mind and caused him to raise his
eyes.&nbsp; They rested on her own&mdash;which for an appreciable
moment she didn&rsquo;t withdraw.&nbsp; The latter were brilliant
and expressive, and surmounted a delicate aquiline nose, which,
though pretty, was perhaps just a trifle too hawk-like.&nbsp; It
was the oddest coincidence in the world; the story Vogelstein had
taken up treated of a flighty forward little American girl who
plants herself in front of a young man in the garden of an
hotel.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t the conduct of this young lady a
testimony to the truthfulness of the tale, and wasn&rsquo;t
Vogelstein himself in the position of the young man in the
garden?&nbsp; That young man&mdash;though with more, in such
connexions in general, to go upon&mdash;ended by addressing
himself to his aggressor, as she might be called, and after a
very short hesitation Vogelstein followed his example.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If she wants to know who I am she&rsquo;s welcome,&rdquo;
he said to himself; and he got out of the chair, seized it by the
back and, turning it round, exhibited the superscription to the
girl.&nbsp; She coloured slightly, but smiled and read his name,
while Vogelstein raised his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all
right,&rdquo; she remarked as if the discovery had made her very
happy.</p>
<p>It affected him indeed as all right that he should be Count
Otto Vogelstein; this appeared even rather a flippant mode of
disposing of the fact.&nbsp; By way of rejoinder he asked her if
she desired of him the surrender of his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you; of course not.&nbsp; I
thought you had one of our chairs, and I didn&rsquo;t like to ask
you.&nbsp; It looks exactly like one of ours; not so much now as
when you sit in it.&nbsp; Please sit down again.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want to trouble you.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve lost one of
ours, and I&rsquo;ve been looking for it everywhere.&nbsp; They
look so much alike; you can&rsquo;t tell till you see the
back.&nbsp; Of course I see there will be no mistake about
yours,&rdquo; the young lady went on with a smile of which the
serenity matched her other abundance.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
we&rsquo;ve got such a small name&mdash;you can scarcely see
it,&rdquo; she added with the same friendly intention.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our name&rsquo;s just Day&mdash;you mightn&rsquo;t think
it <i>was</i> a name, might you? if we didn&rsquo;t make the most
of it.&nbsp; If you see that on anything, I&rsquo;d be so obliged
if you&rsquo;d tell me.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t for myself,
it&rsquo;s for my mother; she&rsquo;s so dependent on her chair,
and that one I&rsquo;m looking for pulls out so
beautifully.&nbsp; Now that you sit down again and hide the lower
part it does look just like ours.&nbsp; Well, it must be
somewhere.&nbsp; You must excuse me; I wouldn&rsquo;t disturb
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a long and even confidential speech for a young
woman, presumably unmarried, to make to a perfect stranger; but
Miss Day acquitted herself of it with perfect simplicity and
self-possession.&nbsp; She held up her head and stepped away, and
Vogelstein could see that the foot she pressed upon the clean
smooth deck was slender and shapely.&nbsp; He watched her
disappear through the trap by which she had ascended, and he felt
more than ever like the young man in his American tale.&nbsp; The
girl in the present case was older and not so pretty, as he could
easily judge, for the image of her smiling eyes and speaking lips
still hovered before him.&nbsp; He went back to his book with the
feeling that it would give him some information about her.&nbsp;
This was rather illogical, but it indicated a certain amount of
curiosity on the part of Count Vogelstein.&nbsp; The girl in the
book had a mother, it appeared, and so had this young lady; the
former had also a brother, and he now remembered that he had
noticed a young man on the wharf&mdash;a young man in a high hat
and a white overcoat&mdash;who seemed united to Miss Day by this
natural tie.&nbsp; And there was some one else too, as he
gradually recollected, an older man, also in a high hat, but in a
black overcoat&mdash;in black altogether&mdash;who completed the
group and who was presumably the head of the family.&nbsp; These
reflexions would indicate that Count Vogelstein read his volume
of Tauchnitz rather interruptedly.&nbsp; Moreover they
represented but the loosest economy of consciousness; for
wasn&rsquo;t he to be afloat in an oblong box for ten days with
such people, and could it be doubted he should see at least
enough of them?</p>
<p>It may as well be written without delay that he saw a great
deal of them.&nbsp; I have sketched in some detail the conditions
in which he made the acquaintance of Miss Day, because the event
had a certain importance for this fair square Teuton; but I must
pass briefly over the incidents that immediately followed
it.&nbsp; He wondered what it was open to him, after such an
introduction, to do in relation to her, and he determined he
would push through his American tale and discover what the hero
did.&nbsp; But he satisfied himself in a very short time that
Miss Day had nothing in common with the heroine of that work save
certain signs of habitat and climate&mdash;and save, further, the
fact that the male sex wasn&rsquo;t terrible to her.&nbsp; The
local stamp sharply, as he gathered, impressed upon her he
estimated indeed rather in a borrowed than in a natural light,
for if she was native to a small town in the interior of the
American continent one of their fellow-passengers, a lady from
New York with whom he had a good deal of conversation, pronounced
her &ldquo;atrociously&rdquo; provincial.&nbsp; How the lady
arrived at this certitude didn&rsquo;t appear, for Vogelstein
observed that she held no communication with the girl.&nbsp; It
was true she gave it the support of her laying down that certain
Americans could tell immediately who other Americans were,
leaving him to judge whether or no she herself belonged to the
critical or only to the criticised half of the nation.&nbsp; Mrs.
Dangerfield was a handsome confidential insinuating woman, with
whom Vogelstein felt his talk take a very wide range
indeed.&nbsp; She convinced him rather effectually that even in a
great democracy there are human differences, and that American
life was full of social distinctions, of delicate shades, which
foreigners often lack the intelligence to perceive.&nbsp; Did he
suppose every one knew every one else in the biggest country in
the world, and that one wasn&rsquo;t as free to choose
one&rsquo;s company there as in the most monarchical and most
exclusive societies?&nbsp; She laughed such delusions to scorn as
Vogelstein tucked her beautiful furred coverlet&mdash;they
reclined together a great deal in their elongated
chairs&mdash;well over her feet.&nbsp; How free an American lady
was to choose her company she abundantly proved by not knowing
any one on the steamer but Count Otto.</p>
<p>He could see for himself that Mr. and Mrs. Day had not at all
her grand air.&nbsp; They were fat plain serious people who sat
side by side on the deck for hours and looked straight before
them.&nbsp; Mrs. Day had a white face, large cheeks and small
eyes: her forehead was surrounded with a multitude of little
tight black curls; her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge
in her mouth.&nbsp; She wore entwined about her head an article
which Mrs. Dangerfield spoke of as a &ldquo;nuby,&rdquo; a
knitted pink scarf concealing her hair, encircling her neck and
having among its convolutions a hole for her perfectly
expressionless face.&nbsp; Her hands were folded on her stomach,
and in her still, swathed figure her little bead-like eyes, which
occasionally changed their direction, alone represented
life.&nbsp; Her husband had a stiff grey beard on his chin and a
bare spacious upper lip, to which constant shaving had imparted a
hard glaze.&nbsp; His eyebrows were thick and his nostrils wide,
and when he was uncovered, in the saloon, it was visible that his
grizzled hair was dense and perpendicular.&nbsp; He might have
looked rather grim and truculent hadn&rsquo;t it been for the
mild familiar accommodating gaze with which his large
light-coloured pupils&mdash;the leisurely eyes of a silent
man&mdash;appeared to consider surrounding objects.&nbsp; He was
evidently more friendly than fierce, but he was more diffident
than friendly.&nbsp; He liked to have you in sight, but
wouldn&rsquo;t have pretended to understand you much or to
classify you, and would have been sorry it should put you under
an obligation.&nbsp; He and his wife spoke sometimes, but seldom
talked, and there was something vague and patient in them, as if
they had become victims of a wrought spell.&nbsp; The spell
however was of no sinister cast; it was the fascination of
prosperity, the confidence of security, which sometimes makes
people arrogant, but which had had such a different effect on
this simple satisfied pair, in whom further development of every
kind appeared to have been happily arrested.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dangerfield made it known to Count Otto that every
morning after breakfast, the hour at which he wrote his journal
in his cabin, the old couple were guided upstairs and installed
in their customary corner by Pandora.&nbsp; This she had learned
to be the name of their elder daughter, and she was immensely
amused by her discovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pandora&rdquo;&mdash;that
was in the highest degree typical; it placed them in the social
scale if other evidence had been wanting; you could tell that a
girl was from the interior, the mysterious interior about which
Vogelstein&rsquo;s imagination was now quite excited, when she
had such a name as that.&nbsp; This young lady managed the whole
family, even a little the small beflounced sister, who, with bold
pretty innocent eyes, a torrent of fair silky hair, a crimson
fez, such as is worn by male Turks, very much askew on top of it,
and a way of galloping and straddling about the ship in any
company she could pick up&mdash;she had long thin legs, very
short skirts and stockings of every tint&mdash;was going home, in
elegant French clothes, to resume an interrupted education.&nbsp;
Pandora overlooked and directed her relatives; Vogelstein could
see this for himself, could see she was very active and decided,
that she had in a high degree the sentiment of responsibility,
settling on the spot most of the questions that could come up for
a family from the interior.</p>
<p>The voyage was remarkably fine, and day after day it was
possible to sit there under the salt sky and feel one&rsquo;s
self rounding the great curves of the globe.&nbsp; The long deck
made a white spot in the sharp black circle of the ocean and in
the intense sea-light, while the shadow of the smoke-streamers
trembled on the familiar floor, the shoes of fellow-passengers,
distinctive now, and in some cases irritating, passed and
repassed, accompanied, in the air so tremendously
&ldquo;open,&rdquo; that rendered all voices weak and most
remarks rather flat, by fragments of opinion on the run of the
ship.&nbsp; Vogelstein by this time had finished his little
American story and now definitely judged that Pandora Day was not
at all like the heroine.&nbsp; She was of quite another type;
much more serious and strenuous, and not at all keen, as he had
supposed, about making the acquaintance of gentlemen.&nbsp; Her
speaking to him that first afternoon had been, he was bound to
believe, an incident without importance for herself; in spite of
her having followed it up the next day by the remark, thrown at
him as she passed, with a smile that was almost fraternal:
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, sir!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found that old
chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this she hadn&rsquo;t spoken to him
again and had scarcely looked at him.&nbsp; She read a great
deal, and almost always French books, in fresh yellow paper; not
the lighter forms of that literature, but a volume of
Sainte-Beuve, of Renan or at the most, in the way of dissipation,
of Alfred de Musset.&nbsp; She took frequent exercise and almost
always walked alone, apparently not having made many friends on
the ship and being without the resource of her parents, who, as
has been related, never budged out of the cosy corner in which
she planted them for the day.</p>
<p>Her brother was always in the smoking-room, where Vogelstein
observed him, in very tight clothes, his neck encircled with a
collar like a palisade.&nbsp; He had a sharp little face, which
was not disagreeable; he smoked enormous cigars and began his
drinking early in the day: but his appearance gave no sign of
these excesses.&nbsp; As regards euchre and poker and the other
distractions of the place he was guilty of none.&nbsp; He
evidently understood such games in perfection, for he used to
watch the players, and even at moments impartially advise them;
but Vogelstein never saw the cards in his hand.&nbsp; He was
referred to as regards disputed points, and his opinion carried
the day.&nbsp; He took little part in the conversation, usually
much relaxed, that prevailed in the smoking-room, but from time
to time he made, in his soft flat youthful voice, a remark which
every one paused to listen to and which was greeted with roars of
laughter.&nbsp; Vogelstein, well as he knew English, could rarely
catch the joke; but he could see at least that these must be
choice specimens of that American humour admired and practised by
a whole continent and yet to be rendered accessible to a trained
diplomatist, clearly, but by some special and incalculable
revelation.&nbsp; The young man, in his way, was very remarkable,
for, as Vogelstein heard some one say once after the laughter had
subsided, he was only nineteen.&nbsp; If his sister didn&rsquo;t
resemble the dreadful little girl in the tale already mentioned,
there was for Vogelstein at least an analogy between young Mr.
Day and a certain small brother&mdash;a candy-loving Madison,
Hamilton or Jefferson&mdash;who was, in the Tauchnitz volume,
attributed to that unfortunate maid.&nbsp; This was what the
little Madison would have grown up to at nineteen, and the
improvement was greater than might have been expected.</p>
<p>The days were long, but the voyage was short, and it had
almost come to an end before Count Otto yielded to an attraction
peculiar in its nature and finally irresistible, and, in spite of
Mrs. Dangerfield&rsquo;s emphatic warning, sought occasion for a
little continuous talk with Miss Pandora.&nbsp; To mention that
this impulse took effect without mentioning sundry other of his
current impressions with which it had nothing to do is perhaps to
violate proportion and give a false idea; but to pass it by would
be still more unjust.&nbsp; The Germans, as we know, are a
transcendental people, and there was at last an irresistible
appeal for Vogelstein in this quick bright silent girl who could
smile and turn vocal in an instant, who imparted a rare
originality to the filial character, and whose profile was
delicate as she bent it over a volume which she cut as she read,
or presented it in musing attitudes, at the side of the ship, to
the horizon they had left behind.&nbsp; But he felt it to be a
pity, as regards a possible acquaintance with her, that her
parents should be heavy little burghers, that her brother should
not correspond to his conception of a young man of the upper
class, and that her sister should be a Daisy Miller <i>en
herbe</i>.&nbsp; Repeatedly admonished by Mrs. Dangerfield, the
young diplomatist was doubly careful as to the relations he might
form at the beginning of his sojourn in the United States.&nbsp;
That lady reminded him, and he had himself made the observation
in other capitals, that the first year, and even the second, is
the time for prudence.&nbsp; One was ignorant of proportions and
values; one was exposed to mistakes and thankful for attention,
and one might give one&rsquo;s self away to people who would
afterwards be as a millstone round one&rsquo;s neck: Mrs.
Dangerfield struck and sustained that note, which resounded in
the young man&rsquo;s imagination.&nbsp; She assured him that if
he didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;look out&rdquo; he would be committing
himself to some American girl with an impossible family.&nbsp; In
America, when one committed one&rsquo;s self, there was nothing
to do but march to the altar, and what should he say for instance
to finding himself a near relation of Mr. and Mrs. P. W.
Day?&mdash;since such were the initials inscribed on the back of
the two chairs of that couple.&nbsp; Count Otto felt the peril,
for he could immediately think of a dozen men he knew who had
married American girls.&nbsp; There appeared now to be a constant
danger of marrying the American girl; it was something one had to
reckon with, like the railway, the telegraph, the discovery of
dynamite, the Chassep&ocirc;t rifle, the Socialistic spirit: it
was one of the complications of modern life.</p>
<p>It would doubtless be too much to say that he feared being
carried away by a passion for a young woman who was not
strikingly beautiful and with whom he had talked, in all, but ten
minutes.&nbsp; But, as we recognise, he went so far as to wish
that the human belongings of a person whose high spirit appeared
to have no taint either of fastness, as they said in England, or
of subversive opinion, and whose mouth had charming lines, should
not be a little more distinguished.&nbsp; There was an effect of
drollery in her behaviour to these subjects of her zeal, whom she
seemed to regard as a care, but not as an interest; it was as if
they had been entrusted to her honour and she had engaged to
convey them safe to a certain point; she was detached and
inadvertent, and then suddenly remembered, repented and came back
to tuck them into their blankets, to alter the position of her
mother&rsquo;s umbrella, to tell them something about the run of
the ship.&nbsp; These little offices were usually performed
deftly, rapidly, with the minimum of words, and when their
daughter drew near them Mr. and Mrs. Day closed their eyes after
the fashion of a pair of household dogs who expect to be
scratched.</p>
<p>One morning she brought up the Captain of the ship to present
to them; she appeared to have a private and independent
acquaintance with this officer, and the introduction to her
parents had the air of a sudden happy thought.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t so much an introduction as an exhibition, as if she
were saying to him: &ldquo;This is what they look like; see how
comfortable I make them.&nbsp; Aren&rsquo;t they rather queer and
rather dear little people?&nbsp; But they leave me perfectly
free.&nbsp; Oh I can assure you of that.&nbsp; Besides, you must
see it for yourself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Day looked up at
the high functionary who thus unbent to them with very little
change of countenance; then looked at each other in the same
way.&nbsp; He saluted, he inclined himself a moment; but Pandora
shook her head, she seemed to be answering for them; she made
little gestures as if in explanation to the good Captain of some
of their peculiarities, as for instance that he needn&rsquo;t
expect them to speak.&nbsp; They closed their eyes at last; she
appeared to have a kind of mesmeric influence on them, and Miss
Day walked away with the important friend, who treated her with
evident consideration, bowing very low, for all his importance,
when the two presently after separated.&nbsp; Vogelstein could
see she was capable of making an impression; and the moral of our
little matter is that in spite of Mrs. Dangerfield, in spite of
the resolutions of his prudence, in spite of the limits of such
acquaintance as he had momentarily made with her, in spite of Mr.
and Mrs. Day and the young man in the smoking-room, she had fixed
his attention.</p>
<p>It was in the course of the evening after the scene with the
Captain that he joined her, awkwardly, abruptly, irresistibly, on
the deck, where she was pacing to and fro alone, the hour being
auspiciously mild and the stars remarkably fine.&nbsp; There were
scattered talkers and smokers and couples, unrecognisable, that
moved quickly through the gloom.&nbsp; The vessel dipped with
long regular pulsations; vague and spectral under the low stars,
its swaying pinnacles spotted here and there with lights, it
seemed to rush through the darkness faster than by day.&nbsp;
Count Otto had come up to walk, and as the girl brushed past him
he distinguished Pandora&rsquo;s face&mdash;with Mrs. Dangerfield
he always spoke of her as Pandora&mdash;under the veil worn to
protect it from the sea-damp.&nbsp; He stopped, turned, hurried
after her, threw away his cigar&mdash;then asked her if she would
do him the honour to accept his arm.&nbsp; She declined his arm
but accepted his company, and he allowed her to enjoy it for an
hour.&nbsp; They had a great deal of talk, and he was to remember
afterwards some of the things she had said.&nbsp; There was now a
certainty of the ship&rsquo;s getting into dock the next morning
but one, and this prospect afforded an obvious topic.&nbsp; Some
of Miss Day&rsquo;s expressions struck him as singular, but of
course, as he was aware, his knowledge of English was not nice
enough to give him a perfect measure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a hurry to arrive; I&rsquo;m very
happy here,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I
shall have such a time putting my people through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Putting them through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the Custom-House.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve made so
many purchases.&nbsp; Well, I&rsquo;ve written to a friend to
come down, and perhaps he can help us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s very well
acquainted with the head.&nbsp; Once I&rsquo;m chalked I
don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; I feel like a kind of blackboard by this
time anyway.&nbsp; We found them awful in Germany.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Otto wondered if the friend she had written to were her
lover and if they had plighted their troth, especially when she
alluded to him again as &ldquo;that gentleman who&rsquo;s coming
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; He asked her about her travels, her
impressions, whether she had been long in Europe and what she
liked best, and she put it to him that they had gone abroad, she
and her family, for a little fresh experience.&nbsp; Though he
found her very intelligent he suspected she gave this as a reason
because he was a German and she had heard the Germans were rich
in culture.&nbsp; He wondered what form of culture Mr. and Mrs.
Day had brought back from Italy, Greece and Palestine&mdash;they
had travelled for two years and been everywhere&mdash;especially
when their daughter said: &ldquo;I wanted father and mother to
see the best things.&nbsp; I kept them three hours on the
Acropolis.&nbsp; I guess they won&rsquo;t forget
that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps it was of Phidias and Pericles they
were thinking, Vogelstein reflected, as they sat ruminating in
their rugs.&nbsp; Pandora remarked also that she wanted to show
her little sister everything while she was comparatively unformed
(&ldquo;comparatively!&rdquo; he mutely gasped); remarkable
sights made so much more impression when the mind was fresh: she
had read something of that sort somewhere in Goethe.&nbsp; She
had wanted to come herself when she was her sister&rsquo;s age;
but her father was in business then and they couldn&rsquo;t leave
Utica.&nbsp; The young man thought of the little sister frisking
over the Parthenon and the Mount of Olives and sharing for two
years, the years of the school-room, this extraordinary
pilgrimage of her parents; he wondered whether Goethe&rsquo;s
dictum had been justified in this case.&nbsp; He asked Pandora if
Utica were the seat of her family, if it were an important or
typical place, if it would be an interesting city for him, as a
stranger, to see.&nbsp; His companion replied frankly that this
was a big question, but added that all the same she would ask him
to &ldquo;come and visit us at our home&rdquo; if it
weren&rsquo;t that they should probably soon leave it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re going to live elsewhere?&rdquo;
Vogelstein asked, as if that fact too would be typical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m working for New York.&nbsp; I flatter
myself I&rsquo;ve loosened them while we&rsquo;ve been
away,&rdquo; the girl went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t find
in Utica the same charm; that was my idea.&nbsp; I want a big
place, and of course Utica&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off as
before a complex statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose Utica is inferior&mdash;?&rdquo; Vogelstein
seemed to see his way to suggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well no, I guess I can&rsquo;t have you call Utica
inferior.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t supreme&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s the matter with it, and I hate anything
middling,&rdquo; said Pandora Day.&nbsp; She gave a light dry
laugh, tossing back her head a little as she made this
declaration.&nbsp; And looking at her askance in the dusk, as she
trod the deck that vaguely swayed, he recognised something in her
air and port that matched such a pronouncement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her social position?&rdquo; he inquired of
Mrs. Dangerfield the next day.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it
out at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s so contradictory.&nbsp; She strikes
me as having much cultivation and much spirit.&nbsp; Her
appearance, too, is very neat.&nbsp; Yet her parents are complete
little burghers.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s easily seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, social position,&rdquo; and Mrs. Dangerfield nodded
two or three times portentously.&nbsp; &ldquo;What big
expressions you use!&nbsp; Do you think everybody in the world
has a social position?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s reserved for an
infinitely small majority of mankind.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t have
a social position at Utica any more than you can have an
opera-box.&nbsp; Pandora hasn&rsquo;t got one; where, if you
please, should she have got it?&nbsp; Poor girl, it isn&rsquo;t
fair of you to make her the subject of such questions as
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Vogelstein, &ldquo;if she&rsquo;s of
the lower class it seems to me
very&mdash;very&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And he paused a moment, as he
often paused in speaking English, looking for his word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very what, dear Count?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very significant, very representative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, she isn&rsquo;t of the lower class,&rdquo;
Mrs. Dangerfield returned with an irritated sense of wasted
wisdom.&nbsp; She liked to explain her country, but that somehow
always required two persons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is she then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m bound to admit that since I was at home
last she&rsquo;s a novelty.&nbsp; A girl like that with such
people&mdash;it <i>is</i> a new type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like novelties&rdquo;&mdash;and Count Otto smiled
with an air of considerable resolution.&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t
however be satisfied with a demonstration that only begged the
question; and when they disembarked in New York he felt, even
amid the confusion of the wharf and the heaps of disembowelled
baggage, a certain acuteness of regret at the idea that Pandora
and her family were about to vanish into the unknown.&nbsp; He
had a consolation however: it was apparent that for some reason
or other&mdash;illness or absence from town&mdash;the gentleman
to whom she had written had not, as she said, come down.&nbsp;
Vogelstein was glad&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t have told you
why&mdash;that this sympathetic person had failed her; even
though without him Pandora had to engage single-handed with the
United States Custom-House.&nbsp; Our young man&rsquo;s first
impression of the Western world was received on the landing-place
of the German steamers at Jersey City&mdash;a huge wooden shed
covering a wooden wharf which resounded under the feet, an
expanse palisaded with rough-hewn piles that leaned this way and
that, and bestrewn with masses of heterogeneous luggage.&nbsp; At
one end; toward the town, was a row of tall painted palings,
behind which he could distinguish a press of hackney-coachmen,
who brandished their whips and awaited their victims, while their
voices rose, incessant, with a sharp strange sound, a challenge
at once fierce and familiar.&nbsp; The whole place, behind the
fence, appeared to bristle and resound.&nbsp; Out there was
America, Count Otto said to himself, and he looked toward it with
a sense that he should have to muster resolution.&nbsp; On the
wharf people were rushing about amid their trunks, pulling their
things together, trying to unite their scattered parcels.&nbsp;
They were heated and angry, or else quite bewildered and
discouraged.&nbsp; The few that had succeeded in collecting their
battered boxes had an air of flushed indifference to the efforts
of their neighbours, not even looking at people with whom they
had been fondly intimate on the steamer.&nbsp; A detachment of
the officers of the Customs was in attendance, and energetic
passengers were engaged in attempts to drag them toward their
luggage or to drag heavy pieces toward them.&nbsp; These
functionaries were good-natured and taciturn, except when
occasionally they remarked to a passenger whose open trunk stared
up at them, eloquent, imploring, that they were afraid the voyage
had been &ldquo;rather glassy.&rdquo;&nbsp; They had a friendly
leisurely speculative way of discharging their duty, and if they
perceived a victim&rsquo;s name written on the portmanteau they
addressed him by it in a tone of old acquaintance.&nbsp;
Vogelstein found however that if they were familiar they
weren&rsquo;t indiscreet.&nbsp; He had heard that in America all
public functionaries were the same, that there wasn&rsquo;t a
different <i>tenue</i>, as they said in France, for different
positions, and he wondered whether at Washington the President
and ministers, whom he expected to see&mdash;to <i>have</i> to
see&mdash;a good deal of, would be like that.</p>
<p>He was diverted from these speculations by the sight of Mr.
and Mrs. Day seated side by side upon a trunk and encompassed
apparently by the accumulations of their tour.&nbsp; Their faces
expressed more consciousness of surrounding objects than he had
hitherto recognised, and there was an air of placid expansion in
the mysterious couple which suggested that this consciousness was
agreeable.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Day were, as they would have said,
real glad to get back.&nbsp; At a little distance, on the edge of
the dock, our observer remarked their son, who had found a place
where, between the sides of two big ships, he could see the
ferry-boats pass; the large pyramidal low-laden ferry-boats of
American waters.&nbsp; He stood there, patient and considering,
with his small neat foot on a coil of rope, his back to
everything that had been disembarked, his neck elongated in its
polished cylinder, while the fragrance of his big cigar mingled
with the odour of the rotting piles, and his little sister,
beside him, hugged a huge post and tried to see how far she could
crane over the water without falling in.&nbsp; Vogelstein&rsquo;s
servant was off in search of an examiner; Count Otto himself had
got his things together and was waiting to be released, fully
expecting that for a person of his importance the ceremony would
be brief.</p>
<p>Before it began he said a word to young Mr. Day, raising his
hat at the same time to the little girl, whom he had not yet
greeted and who dodged his salute by swinging herself boldly
outward to the dangerous side of the pier.&nbsp; She was indeed
still unformed, but was evidently as light as a feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re kept waiting like me.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s very tiresome,&rdquo; Count Otto said.</p>
<p>The young American answered without looking behind him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As soon as we&rsquo;re started we&rsquo;ll go all
right.&nbsp; My sister has written to a gentleman to come
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked for Miss Day to bid her
good-bye,&rdquo; Vogelstein went on; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess she has gone to meet that gentleman; he&rsquo;s
a great friend of hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s her lover!&rdquo; the little girl
broke out.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was always writing to him in
Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother puffed his cigar in silence a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was only for this.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell on you,
sis,&rdquo; he presently added.</p>
<p>But the younger Miss Day gave no heed to his menace; she
addressed herself only, though with all freedom, to
Vogelstein.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is New York; I like it better than
Utica.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had no time to reply, for his servant had arrived with one
of the dispensers of fortune; but as he turned away he wondered,
in the light of the child&rsquo;s preference, about the towns of
the interior.&nbsp; He was naturally exempt from the common
doom.&nbsp; The officer who took him in hand, and who had a large
straw hat and a diamond breastpin, was quite a man of the world,
and in reply to the Count&rsquo;s formal declarations only said,
&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s all right; I guess I&rsquo;ll
just pass you,&rdquo; distributing chalk-marks as if they had
been so many love-pats.&nbsp; The servant had done some
superfluous unlocking and unbuckling, and while he closed the
pieces the officer stood there wiping his forehead and conversing
with Vogelstein.&nbsp; &ldquo;First visit to our country,
sir?&mdash;quite alone&mdash;no ladies?&nbsp; Of course the
ladies are what we&rsquo;re most after.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in
this manner he expressed himself, while the young diplomatist
wondered what he was waiting for and whether he ought to slip
something into his palm.&nbsp; But this representative of order
left our friend only a moment in suspense; he presently turned
away with the remark quite paternally uttered, that he hoped the
Count would make quite a stay; upon which the young man saw how
wrong he should have been to offer a tip.&nbsp; It was simply the
American manner, which had a finish of its own after all.&nbsp;
Vogelstein&rsquo;s servant had secured a porter with a truck, and
he was about to leave the place when he saw Pandora Day dart out
of the crowd and address herself with much eagerness to the
functionary who had just liberated him.&nbsp; She had an open
letter in her hand which she gave him to read and over which he
cast his eyes, thoughtfully stroking his beard.&nbsp; Then she
led him away to where her parents sat on their luggage.&nbsp;
Count Otto sent off his servant with the porter and followed
Pandora, to whom he really wished to address a word of
farewell.&nbsp; The last thing they had said to each other on the
ship was that they should meet again on shore.&nbsp; It seemed
improbable however that the meeting would occur anywhere but just
here on the dock; inasmuch as Pandora was decidedly not in
society, where Vogelstein would be of course, and as, if
Utica&mdash;he had her sharp little sister&rsquo;s word for
it&mdash;was worse than what was about him there, he&rsquo;d be
hanged if he&rsquo;d go to Utica.&nbsp; He overtook Pandora
quickly; she was in the act of introducing the representative of
order to her parents, quite in the same manner in which she had
introduced the Captain of the ship.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Day got up
and shook hands with him and they evidently all prepared to have
a little talk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to introduce you to my
brother and sister,&rdquo; he heard the girl say, and he saw her
look about for these appendages.&nbsp; He caught her eye as she
did so, and advanced with his hand outstretched, reflecting the
while that evidently the Americans, whom he had always heard
described as silent and practical, rejoiced to extravagance in
the social graces.&nbsp; They dawdled and chattered like so many
Neapolitans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Count Vogelstein,&rdquo; said Pandora, who
was a little flushed with her various exertions but didn&rsquo;t
look the worse for it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll have a
splendid time and appreciate our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll get through all right,&rdquo;
Vogelstein answered, smiling and feeling himself already more
idiomatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gentleman&rsquo;s sick that I wrote to,&rdquo; she
rejoined; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it too bad?&nbsp; But he sent me
down a letter to a friend of his&mdash;one of the
examiners&mdash;and I guess we won&rsquo;t have any
trouble.&nbsp; Mr. Lansing, let me make you acquainted with Count
Vogelstein,&rdquo; she went on, presenting to her
fellow-passenger the wearer of the straw hat and the breastpin,
who shook hands with the young German as if he had never seen him
before.&nbsp; Vogelstein&rsquo;s heart rose for an instant to his
throat; he thanked his stars he hadn&rsquo;t offered a tip to the
friend of a gentleman who had often been mentioned to him and who
had also been described by a member of Pandora&rsquo;s family as
Pandora&rsquo;s lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of ladies this time,&rdquo; Mr.
Lansing remarked to him with a smile which seemed to confess
surreptitiously, and as if neither party could be eager, to
recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Bellamy says you&rsquo;ll do anything for
<i>him</i>,&rdquo; Pandora said, smiling very sweetly at Mr.
Lansing.&nbsp; &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t got much; we&rsquo;ve been
gone only two years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Lansing scratched his head a little behind, with a
movement that sent his straw hat forward in the direction of his
nose.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I&rsquo;d do anything
for him that I wouldn&rsquo;t do for you,&rdquo; he responded
with an equal geniality.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;d better
open that one&rdquo;&mdash;and he gave a little affectionate kick
to one of the trunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh mother, isn&rsquo;t he lovely?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only
your sea-things,&rdquo; Pandora cried, stooping over the coffer
with the key in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I like showing them,&rdquo; Mrs.
Day modestly murmured.</p>
<p>Vogelstein made his German salutation to the company in
general, and to Pandora he offered an audible good-bye, which she
returned in a bright friendly voice, but without looking round as
she fumbled at the lock of her trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try another, if you like,&rdquo; said Mr.
Lansing good-humouredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no it has got to be this one!&nbsp; Good-bye, Count
Vogelstein.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll judge us
correctly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man went his way and passed the barrier of the
dock.&nbsp; Here he was met by his English valet with a face of
consternation which led him to ask if a cab weren&rsquo;t
forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call &rsquo;em &rsquo;acks &rsquo;ere, sir,&rdquo;
said the man, &ldquo;and they&rsquo;re beyond everything.&nbsp;
He wants thirty shillings to take you to the inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you
find a German?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way he talks he <i>is</i> a German!&rdquo; said
the man; and in a moment Count Otto began his career in America
by discussing the tariff of hackney-coaches in the language of
the fatherland.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> went wherever he was asked, on
principle, partly to study American society and partly because in
Washington pastimes seemed to him not so numerous that one could
afford to neglect occasions.&nbsp; At the end of two winters he
had naturally had a good many of various kinds&mdash;his study of
American society had yielded considerable fruit.&nbsp; When,
however, in April, during the second year of his residence, he
presented himself at a large party given by Mrs. Bonnycastle and
of which it was believed that it would be the last serious affair
of the season, his being there (and still more his looking very
fresh and talkative) was not the consequence of a rule of
conduct.&nbsp; He went to Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s simply because
he liked the lady, whose receptions were the pleasantest in
Washington, and because if he didn&rsquo;t go there he
didn&rsquo;t know what he should do; that absence of alternatives
having become familiar to him by the waters of the Potomac.&nbsp;
There were a great many things he did because if he didn&rsquo;t
do them he didn&rsquo;t know what he should do.&nbsp; It must be
added that in this case even if there had been an alternative he
would still have decided to go to Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
If her house wasn&rsquo;t the pleasantest there it was at least
difficult to say which was pleasanter; and the complaint
sometimes made of it that it was too limited, that it left out,
on the whole, more people than it took in, applied with much less
force when it was thrown open for a general party.&nbsp; Toward
the end of the social year, in those soft scented days of the
Washington spring when the air began to show a southern glow and
the Squares and Circles (to which the wide empty avenues
converged according to a plan so ingenious, yet so bewildering)
to flush with pink blossom and to make one wish to sit on
benches&mdash;under this magic of expansion and condonation Mrs.
Bonnycastle, who during the winter had been a good deal on the
defensive, relaxed her vigilance a little, became whimsically
wilful, vernally reckless, as it were, and ceased to calculate
the consequences of an hospitality which a reference to the back
files or even to the morning&rsquo;s issue of the newspapers
might easily prove a mistake.&nbsp; But Washington life, to Count
Otto&rsquo;s apprehension, was paved with mistakes; he felt
himself in a society founded on fundamental fallacies and
triumphant blunders.&nbsp; Little addicted as he was to the
sportive view of existence, he had said to himself at an early
stage of his sojourn that the only way to enjoy the great
Republic would be to burn one&rsquo;s standards and warm
one&rsquo;s self at the blaze.&nbsp; Such were the reflexions of
a theoretic Teuton who now walked for the most part amid the
ashes of his prejudices.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnycastle had endeavoured more than once to explain to
him the principles on which she received certain people and
ignored certain others; but it was with difficulty that he
entered into her discriminations.&nbsp; American promiscuity,
goodness knew, had been strange to him, but it was nothing to the
queerness of American criticism.&nbsp; This lady would discourse
to him <i>&agrave; perte de vue</i> on differences where he only
saw resemblances, and both the merits and the defects of a good
many members of Washington society, as this society was
interpreted to him by Mrs. Bonnycastle, he was often at a loss to
understand.&nbsp; Fortunately she had a fund of good humour
which, as I have intimated, was apt to come uppermost with the
April blossoms and which made the people she didn&rsquo;t invite
to her house almost as amusing to her as those she did.&nbsp; Her
husband was not in politics, though politics were much in him;
but the couple had taken upon themselves the responsibilities of
an active patriotism; they thought it right to live in America,
differing therein from many of their acquaintances who only, with
some grimness, thought it inevitable.&nbsp; They had that
burdensome heritage of foreign reminiscence with which so many
Americans were saddled; but they carried it more easily than most
of their country-people, and one knew they had lived in Europe
only by their present exultation, never in the least by their
regrets.&nbsp; Their regrets, that is, were only for their ever
having lived there, as Mrs. Bonnycastle once told the wife of a
foreign minister.&nbsp; They solved all their problems
successfully, including those of knowing none of the people they
didn&rsquo;t wish to, and of finding plenty of occupation in a
society supposed to be meagrely provided with resources for that
body which Vogelstein was to hear invoked, again and again, with
the mixture of desire and of deprecation that might have attended
the mention of a secret vice, under the name of a
leisure-class.&nbsp; When as the warm weather approached they
opened both the wings of their house-door, it was because they
thought it would entertain them and not because they were
conscious of a pressure.&nbsp; Alfred Bonnycastle all winter
indeed chafed a little at the definiteness of some of his
wife&rsquo;s reserves; it struck him that for Washington their
society was really a little too good.&nbsp; Vogelstein still
remembered the puzzled feeling&mdash;it had cleared up somewhat
now&mdash;with which, more than a year before, he had heard Mr.
Bonnycastle exclaim one evening, after a dinner in his own house,
when every guest but the German secretary (who often sat late
with the pair) had departed: &ldquo;Hang it, there&rsquo;s only a
month left; let us be vulgar and have some fun&mdash;let us
invite the President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s carnival, and on the
occasion to which I began my chapter by referring the President
had not only been invited but had signified his intention of
being present.&nbsp; I hasten to add that this was not the same
august ruler to whom Alfred Bonnycastle&rsquo;s irreverent
allusion had been made.&nbsp; The White House had received a new
tenant&mdash;the old one was then just leaving it&mdash;and Count
Otto had had the advantage, during the first eighteen months of
his stay in America, of seeing an electoral campaign, a
presidential inauguration and a distribution of spoils.&nbsp; He
had been bewildered during those first weeks by finding that at
the national capital in the houses he supposed to be the best,
the head of the State was not a coveted guest; for this could be
the only explanation of Mr. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s whimsical
suggestion of their inviting him, as it were, in carnival.&nbsp;
His successor went out a good deal for a President.</p>
<p>The legislative session was over, but this made little
difference in the aspect of Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s rooms, which
even at the height of the congressional season could scarce be
said to overflow with the representatives of the people.&nbsp;
They were garnished with an occasional Senator, whose movements
and utterances often appeared to be regarded with a mixture of
alarm and indulgence, as if they would be disappointing if they
weren&rsquo;t rather odd and yet might be dangerous if not
carefully watched.&nbsp; Our young man had come to entertain a
kindness for these conscript fathers of invisible families, who
had something of the toga in the voluminous folds of their
conversation, but were otherwise rather bare and bald, with stony
wrinkles in their faces, like busts and statues of ancient
law-givers.&nbsp; There seemed to him something chill and exposed
in their being at once so exalted and so naked; there were
frequent lonesome glances in their eyes, as if in the social
world their legislative consciousness longed for the warmth of a
few comfortable laws ready-made.&nbsp; Members of the House were
very rare, and when Washington was new to the inquiring secretary
he used sometimes to mistake them, in the halls and on the
staircases where he met them, for the functionaries engaged,
under stress, to usher in guests and wait at supper.&nbsp; It was
only a little later that he perceived these latter public
characters almost always to be impressive and of that rich racial
hue which of itself served as a livery.&nbsp; At present,
however, such confounding figures were much less to be met than
during the months of winter, and indeed they were never frequent
at Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s.&nbsp; At present the social vistas
of Washington, like the vast fresh flatness of the lettered and
numbered streets, which at this season seemed to Vogelstein more
spacious and vague than ever, suggested but a paucity of
political phenomena.&nbsp; Count Otto that evening knew every one
or almost every one.&nbsp; There were often inquiring strangers,
expecting great things, from New York and Boston, and to them, in
the friendly Washington way, the young German was promptly
introduced.&nbsp; It was a society in which familiarity reigned
and in which people were liable to meet three times a day, so
that their ultimate essence really became a matter of
importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got three new girls,&rdquo; Mrs. Bonnycastle
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must talk to them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All at once?&rdquo; Vogelstein asked, reversing in
fancy a position not at all unknown to him.&nbsp; He had so
repeatedly heard himself addressed in even more than triple
simultaneity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; you must have something different for each; you
can&rsquo;t get off that way.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t you discovered
that the American girl expects something especially adapted to
herself?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s very well for Europe to have a few
phrases that will do for any girl.&nbsp; The American girl
isn&rsquo;t <i>any</i> girl; she&rsquo;s a remarkable specimen in
a remarkable species.&nbsp; But you must keep the best this
evening for Miss Day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For Miss Day!&rdquo;&mdash;and Vogelstein had a stare
of intelligence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean for Pandora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnycastle broke on her side into free amusement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One would think you had been looking for her over the
globe!&nbsp; So you know her already&mdash;and you call her by
her pet name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I don&rsquo;t know her; that is I haven&rsquo;t
seen her or thought of her from that day to this.&nbsp; We came
to America in the same ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she an American then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; she lives at Utica&mdash;in the
interior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the interior of Utica?&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t mean my
young woman then, who lives in New York, where she&rsquo;s a
great beauty and a great belle and has been immensely admired
this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Count Otto, considering and a
little disappointed, &ldquo;the name&rsquo;s not so uncommon;
it&rsquo;s perhaps another.&nbsp; But has she rather strange
eyes, a little yellow, but very pretty, and a nose a little
arched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you all that; I haven&rsquo;t seen
her.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s staying with Mrs. Steuben.&nbsp; She only
came a day or two ago, and Mrs. Steuben&rsquo;s to bring
her.&nbsp; When she wrote to me to ask leave she told me what I
tell you.&nbsp; They haven&rsquo;t come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein felt a quick hope that the subject of this
correspondence might indeed be the young lady he had parted from
on the dock at New York, but the indications seemed to point
another way, and he had no wish to cherish an illusion.&nbsp; It
didn&rsquo;t seem to him probable that the energetic girl who had
introduced him to Mr. Lansing would have the entr&eacute;e of the
best house in Washington; besides, Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s guest
was described as a beauty and belonging to the brilliant
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the social position of Mrs.
Steuben?&rdquo; it occurred to him to ask while he
meditated.&nbsp; He had an earnest artless literal way of putting
such a question as that; you could see from it that he was very
thorough.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnycastle met it, however, but, with mocking
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s your own?&rdquo;&mdash;and she left him to turn to
her other guests, to several of whom she repeated his
question.&nbsp; Could they tell her what was the social position
of Mrs. Steuben?&nbsp; There was Count Vogelstein who wanted to
know.&nbsp; He instantly became aware of course that he
oughtn&rsquo;t so to have expressed himself.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t
the lady&rsquo;s place in the scale sufficiently indicated by
Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s acquaintance with her?&nbsp; Still there
were fine degrees, and he felt a little unduly snubbed.&nbsp; It
was perfectly true, as he told his hostess, that with the quick
wave of new impressions that had rolled over him after his
arrival in America the image of Pandora was almost completely
effaced; he had seen innumerable things that were quite as
remarkable in their way as the heroine of the <i>Donau</i>, but
at the touch of the idea that he might see her and hear her again
at any moment she became as vivid in his mind as if they had
parted the day before: he remembered the exact shade of the eyes
he had described to Mrs. Bonnycastle as yellow, the tone of her
voice when at the last she expressed the hope he might judge
America correctly.&nbsp; <i>Had</i> he judged America
correctly?&nbsp; If he were to meet her again she doubtless would
try to ascertain.&nbsp; It would be going much too far to say
that the idea of such an ordeal was terrible to Count Otto; but
it may at least be said that the thought of meeting Pandora Day
made him nervous.&nbsp; The fact is certainly singular, but I
shall not take on myself to explain it; there are some things
that even the most philosophic historian isn&rsquo;t bound to
account for.</p>
<p>He wandered into another room, and there, at the end of five
minutes, he was introduced by Mrs. Bonnycastle to one of the
young ladies of whom she had spoken.&nbsp; This was a very
intelligent girl who came from Boston and showed much
acquaintance with Spielhagen&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
like them?&rdquo;&nbsp; Vogelstein asked rather vaguely, not
taking much interest in the matter, as he read works of fiction
only in case of a sea-voyage.&nbsp; The young lady from Boston
looked pensive and concentrated; then she answered that she liked
<i>some</i> of them <i>very</i> much, but that there were others
she didn&rsquo;t like&mdash;and she enumerated the works that
came under each of these heads.&nbsp; Spielhagen is a voluminous
writer, and such a catalogue took some time; at the end of it
moreover Vogelstein&rsquo;s question was not answered, for he
couldn&rsquo;t have told us whether she liked Spielhagen or
not.</p>
<p>On the next topic, however, there was no doubt about her
feelings.&nbsp; They talked about Washington as people talk only
in the place itself, revolving about the subject in widening and
narrowing circles, perching successively on its many branches,
considering it from every point of view.&nbsp; Our young man had
been long enough in America to discover that after half a century
of social neglect Washington had become the fashion and enjoyed
the great advantage of being a new resource in
conversation.&nbsp; This was especially the case in the months of
spring, when the inhabitants of the commercial cities came so far
southward to escape, after the long winter, that final
affront.&nbsp; They were all agreed that Washington was
fascinating, and none of them were better prepared to talk it
over than the Bostonians.&nbsp; Vogelstein originally had been
rather out of step with them; he hadn&rsquo;t seized their point
of view, hadn&rsquo;t known with what they compared this object
of their infatuation.&nbsp; But now he knew everything; he had
settled down to the pace; there wasn&rsquo;t a possible phase of
the discussion that could find him at a loss.&nbsp; There was a
kind of Hegelian element in it; in the light of these
considerations the American capital took on the semblance of a
monstrous mystical infinite <i>Werden</i>.&nbsp; But they
fatigued Vogelstein a little, and it was his preference, as a
general thing, not to engage the same evening with more than one
newcomer, one visitor in the freshness of initiation.&nbsp; This
was why Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s expression of a wish to
introduce him to three young ladies had startled him a little; he
saw a certain process, in which he flattered himself that he had
become proficient, but which was after all tolerably exhausting,
repeated for each of the damsels.&nbsp; After separating from his
judicious Bostonian he rather evaded Mrs. Bonnycastle, contenting
himself with the conversation of old friends, pitched for the
most part in a lower and easier key.</p>
<p>At last he heard it mentioned that the President had arrived,
had been some half-hour in the house, and he went in search of
the illustrious guest, whose whereabouts at Washington parties
was never indicated by a cluster of courtiers.&nbsp; He made it a
point, whenever he found himself in company with the President,
to pay him his respects, and he had not been discouraged by the
fact that there was no association of ideas in the eye of the
great man as he put out his hand presidentially and said,
&ldquo;Happy to meet you, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Count Otto felt
himself taken for a mere loyal subject, possibly for an
office-seeker; and he used to reflect at such moments that the
monarchical form had its merits it provided a line of heredity
for the faculty of quick recognition.&nbsp; He had now some
difficulty in finding the chief magistrate, and ended by learning
that he was in the tea-room, a small apartment devoted to light
refection near the entrance of the house.&nbsp; Here our young
man presently perceived him seated on a sofa and in conversation
with a lady.&nbsp; There were a number of people about the table,
eating, drinking, talking; and the couple on the sofa, which was
not near it but against the wall, in a shallow recess, looked a
little withdrawn, as if they had sought seclusion and were
disposed to profit by the diverted attention of the others.&nbsp;
The President leaned back; his gloved hands, resting on either
knee, made large white spots.&nbsp; He looked eminent, but he
looked relaxed, and the lady beside him ministered freely and
without scruple, it was clear, to this effect of his comfortably
unbending.&nbsp; Vogelstein caught her voice as he
approached.&nbsp; He heard her say &ldquo;Well now, remember; I
consider it a promise.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was beautifully dressed,
in rose-colour; her hands were clasped in her lap and her eyes
attached to the presidential profile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, madam, in that case it&rsquo;s about the fiftieth
promise I&rsquo;ve given to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just as he heard these words, uttered by her companion
in reply, that Count Otto checked himself, turned away and
pretended to be looking for a cup of tea.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t
usual to disturb the President, even simply to shake hands, when
he was sitting on a sofa with a lady, and the young secretary
felt it in this case less possible than ever to break the rule,
for the lady on the sofa was none other than Pandora Day.&nbsp;
He had recognised her without her appearing to see him, and even
with half an eye, as they said, had taken in that she was now a
person to be reckoned with.&nbsp; She had an air of elation, of
success; she shone, to intensity, in her rose-coloured dress; she
was extracting promises from the ruler of fifty millions of
people.&nbsp; What an odd place to meet her, her old shipmate
thought, and how little one could tell, after all, in America,
who people were!&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t want to speak to her yet;
he wanted to wait a little and learn more; but meanwhile there
was something attractive in the fact that she was just behind
him, a few yards off, that if he should turn he might see her
again.&nbsp; It was she Mrs. Bonnycastle had meant, it was she
who was so much admired in New York.&nbsp; Her face was the same,
yet he had made out in a moment that she was vaguely prettier; he
had recognised the arch of her nose, which suggested a fine
ambition.&nbsp; He took some tea, which he hadn&rsquo;t desired,
in order not to go away.&nbsp; He remembered her <i>entourage</i>
on the steamer; her father and mother, the silent senseless
burghers, so little &ldquo;of the world,&rdquo; her infant
sister, so much of it, her humorous brother with his tall hat and
his influence in the smoking-room.&nbsp; He remembered Mrs.
Dangerfield&rsquo;s warnings&mdash;yet her perplexities
too&mdash;and the letter from Mr. Bellamy, and the introduction
to Mr. Lansing, and the way Pandora had stooped down on the dirty
dock, laughing and talking, mistress of the situation, to open
her trunk for the Customs.&nbsp; He was pretty sure she had paid
no duties that day; this would naturally have been the purpose of
Mr. Bellamy&rsquo;s letter.&nbsp; Was she still in correspondence
with that gentleman, and had he got over the sickness interfering
with their reunion?&nbsp; These images and these questions
coursed through Count Otto&rsquo;s mind, and he saw it must be
quite in Pandora&rsquo;s line to be mistress of the situation,
for there was evidently nothing on the present occasion that
could call itself her master.&nbsp; He drank his tea and as; he
put down his cup heard the President, behind him, say:
&ldquo;Well, I guess my wife will wonder why I don&rsquo;t come
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring her with you?&rdquo; Pandora
benevolently asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she doesn&rsquo;t go out much.&nbsp; Then she has
got her sister staying with her&mdash;Mrs. Runkle, from
Natchez.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a good deal of an invalid, and my wife
doesn&rsquo;t like to leave her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must be a very kind woman&rdquo;&mdash;and there
was a high mature competence in the way the girl sounded the note
of approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess she isn&rsquo;t
spoiled&mdash;yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to come and see her,&rdquo;
said Pandora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come round.&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t you come some
night?&rdquo; the great man responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come some time.&nbsp; And I shall
remind you of your promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing like keeping it
up.&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; said the President, &ldquo;I must bid
good-bye to these bright folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein heard him rise from the sofa with his companion;
after which he gave the pair time to pass out of the room before
him.&nbsp; They did it with a certain impressive deliberation,
people making way for the ruler of fifty millions and looking
with a certain curiosity at the striking pink person at his
side.&nbsp; When a little later he followed them across the hall,
into one of the other rooms, he saw the host and hostess
accompany the President to the door and two foreign ministers and
a judge of the Supreme Court address themselves to Pandora
Day.&nbsp; He resisted the impulse to join this circle: if he
should speak to her at all he would somehow wish it to be in more
privacy.&nbsp; She continued nevertheless to occupy him, and when
Mrs. Bonnycastle came back from the hall he immediately
approached her with an appeal.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d
tell me something more about that girl&mdash;that one opposite
and in pink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lovely Day&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they call her, I
believe?&nbsp; I wanted you to talk with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find she is the one I&rsquo;ve met.&nbsp; But she
seems to be so different here.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t make it
out,&rdquo; said Count Otto.</p>
<p>There was something in his expression that again moved Mrs.
Bonnycastle to mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;How we do puzzle you
Europeans!&nbsp; You look quite bewildered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I look so&mdash;I try to hide it.&nbsp;
But of course we&rsquo;re very simple.&nbsp; Let me ask then a
simple earnest childlike question.&nbsp; Are her parents also in
society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Parents in society?&nbsp; D&rsquo;o&ugrave;
tombez-vous?&nbsp; Did you ever hear of the parents of a
triumphant girl in rose-colour, with a nose all her own, in
society?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she then all alone?&rdquo; he went on with a strain
of melancholy in his voice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Bonnycastle launched at him all her laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too pathetic.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know
what she is?&nbsp; I supposed of course you knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m asking
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why she&rsquo;s the new type.&nbsp; It has only come up
lately.&nbsp; They have had articles about it in the
papers.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the reason I told Mrs. Steuben to
bring her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new type?&nbsp; <i>What</i> new type, Mrs.
Bonnycastle?&rdquo; he returned pleadingly&mdash;so conscious was
he that all types in America were new.</p>
<p>Her laughter checked her reply a moment, and by the time she
had recovered herself the young lady from Boston, with whom
Vogelstein had been talking, stood there to take leave.&nbsp;
This, for an American type, was an old one, he was sure; and the
process of parting between the guest and her hostess had an
ancient elaboration.&nbsp; Count Otto waited a little; then he
turned away and walked up to Pandora Day, whose group of
interlocutors had now been re-enforced by a gentleman who had
held an important place in the cabinet of the late occupant of
the presidential chair.&nbsp; He had asked Mrs. Bonnycastle if
she were &ldquo;all alone&rdquo;; but there was nothing in her
present situation to show her for solitary.&nbsp; She
wasn&rsquo;t sufficiently alone for our friend&rsquo;s taste; but
he was impatient and he hoped she&rsquo;d give him a few words to
himself.&nbsp; She recognised him without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation and with the sweetest smile, a smile matching to a
shade the tone in which she said: &ldquo;I was watching
you.&nbsp; I wondered if you weren&rsquo;t going to speak to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Day was watching him!&rdquo; one of the foreign
ministers exclaimed; &ldquo;and we flattered ourselves that her
attention was all with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean before,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;while I was
talking with the President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At which the gentlemen began to laugh, one of them remarking
that this was the way the absent were sacrificed, even the great;
while another put on record that he hoped Vogelstein was duly
flattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I was watching the President too,&rdquo; said
Pandora.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to watch <i>him</i>.&nbsp;
He has promised me something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be the mission to England,&rdquo; the judge of
the Supreme Court suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;A good position for a
lady; they&rsquo;ve got a lady at the head over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they would send you to my country,&rdquo; one of
the foreign ministers suggested.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
immediately get recalled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why perhaps in your country I wouldn&rsquo;t speak to
you!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only because you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; the
ex-heroine of the <i>Donau</i> returned with a gay familiarity
which evidently ranked with her but as one of the arts of
defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see what mission it is when it
comes out.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll speak to Count Vogelstein
anywhere,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an older
friend than any right here.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve known him in
difficult days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, on the great ocean,&rdquo; the young man
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the watery waste, in the
tempest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I don&rsquo;t mean that so much; we had a beautiful
voyage and there wasn&rsquo;t any tempest.&nbsp; I mean when I
was living in Utica.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a watery waste if you
like, and a tempest there would have been a pleasant
variety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your parents seemed to me so peaceful!&rdquo; her
associate in the other memories sighed with a vague wish to say
something sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh you haven&rsquo;t seen them ashore!&nbsp; At Utica
they were very lively.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s no longer our
natural home.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember I told you I was
working for New York?&nbsp; Well, I worked&mdash;I had to work
hard.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ve moved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Otto clung to his interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I hope
they&rsquo;re happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father and mother?&nbsp; Oh they will be, in
time.&nbsp; I must give them time.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re very young
yet, they&rsquo;ve years before them.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ve been
always in Washington?&rdquo; Pandora continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose you&rsquo;ve found out everything about
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no&mdash;there are some things I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see me and perhaps I can help you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m very different from what I was in that phase.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve advanced a great deal since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh how was Miss Day in that phase?&rdquo; asked a
cabinet minister of the last administration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was delightful of course,&rdquo; Count Otto
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very flattering; I didn&rsquo;t open my
mouth!&rdquo; Pandora cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here comes Mrs. Steuben
to take me to some other place.&nbsp; I believe it&rsquo;s a
literary party near the Capitol.&nbsp; Everything seems so
separate in Washington.&nbsp; Mrs. Steuben&rsquo;s going to read
a poem.&nbsp; I wish she&rsquo;d read it here; wouldn&rsquo;t it
do as well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This lady, arriving, signified to her young friend the
necessity of their moving on.&nbsp; But Miss Day&rsquo;s
companions had various things to say to her before giving her
up.&nbsp; She had a vivid answer for each, and it was brought
home to Vogelstein while he listened that this would be indeed,
in her development, as she said, another phase.&nbsp; Daughter of
small burghers as she might be she was really brilliant.&nbsp; He
turned away a little and while Mrs. Steuben waited put her a
question.&nbsp; He had made her half an hour before the subject
of that inquiry to which Mrs. Bonnycastle returned so ambiguous
an answer; but this wasn&rsquo;t because he failed of all direct
acquaintance with the amiable woman or of any general idea of the
esteem in which she was held.&nbsp; He had met her in various
places and had been at her house.&nbsp; She was the widow of a
commodore, was a handsome mild soft swaying person, whom every
one liked, with glossy bands of black hair and a little ringlet
depending behind each ear.&nbsp; Some one had said that she
looked like the <i>vieux jeu</i>, idea of the queen in
<i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; She had written verses which were admired in
the South, wore a full-length portrait of the commodore on her
bosom and spoke with the accent of Savannah.&nbsp; She had about
her a positive strong odour of Washington.&nbsp; It had certainly
been very superfluous in our young man to question Mrs.
Bonnycastle about her social position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do kindly tell me,&rdquo; he said, lowering his voice,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the type to which that young lady
belongs?&nbsp; Mrs. Bonnycastle tells me it&rsquo;s a new
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Steuben for a moment fixed her liquid eyes on the
secretary of legation.&nbsp; She always seemed to be translating
the prose of your speech into the finer rhythms with which her
own mind was familiar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think anything&rsquo;s
really new?&rdquo; she then began to flute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very fond of the old; you know that&rsquo;s a
weakness of we Southerners.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poor lady, it will
be observed, had another weakness as well.&nbsp; &ldquo;What we
often take to be the new is simply the old under some novel
form.&nbsp; Were there not remarkable natures in the past?&nbsp;
If you doubt it you should visit the South, where the past still
lingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein had been struck before this with Mrs.
Steuben&rsquo;s pronunciation of the word by which her native
latitudes were designated; transcribing it from her lips you
would have written it (as the nearest approach) the Sooth.&nbsp;
But at present he scarce heeded this peculiarity; he was
wondering rather how a woman could be at once so copious and so
uninforming.&nbsp; What did he care about the past or even about
the Sooth?&nbsp; He was afraid of starting her again.&nbsp; He
looked at her, discouraged and helpless, as bewildered almost as
Mrs. Bonnycastle had found him half an hour before; looked also
at the commodore, who, on her bosom, seemed to breathe again with
his widow&rsquo;s respirations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call it an old type
then if you like,&rdquo; he said in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;All I
want to know is what type it <i>is</i>!&nbsp; It seems
impossible,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can find out in the newspapers.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve
had articles about it.&nbsp; They write about everything
now.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t true about Miss Day.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s one of the first families.&nbsp; Her great-grandfather
was in the Revolution.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pandora by this time had
given her attention again to Mrs. Steuben.&nbsp; She seemed to
signify that she was ready to move on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
your great-grandfather in the Revolution?&rdquo; the elder lady
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling Count Vogelstein about
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you asking about my ancestors?&rdquo; the girl
demanded of the young German with untempered brightness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is that the thing you said just now that you can&rsquo;t
find out?&nbsp; Well, if Mrs. Steuben will only be quiet you
never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Steuben shook her head rather dreamily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no trouble for we of the Sooth to be
quiet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a kind of languor in our blood.&nbsp;
Besides, we have to be to-day.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve got to show
some energy to-night.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to get you to the end
of Pennsylvania Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pandora gave her hand to Count Otto and asked him if he
thought they should meet again.&nbsp; He answered that in
Washington people were always meeting again and that at any rate
he shouldn&rsquo;t fail to wait upon her.&nbsp; Hereupon, just as
the two ladies were detaching themselves, Mrs. Steuben remarked
that if the Count and Miss Day wished to meet again the picnic
would be a good chance&mdash;the picnic she was getting up for
the following Thursday.&nbsp; It was to consist of about twenty
bright people, and they&rsquo;d go down the Potomac to Mount
Vernon.&nbsp; The Count answered that if Mrs. Steuben thought him
bright enough he should be delighted to join the party; and he
was told the hour for which the tryst was taken.</p>
<p>He remained at Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s after every one had
gone, and then he informed this lady of his reason for
waiting.&nbsp; Would she have mercy on him and let him know, in a
single word, before he went to rest&mdash;for without it rest
would be impossible&mdash;what was this famous type to which
Pandora Day belonged?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious, you don&rsquo;t mean to say you&rsquo;ve not
found out that type yet!&rdquo; Mrs. Bonnycastle exclaimed with a
return of her hilarity.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you been doing all
the evening?&nbsp; You Germans may be thorough, but you certainly
are not quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Alfred Bonnycastle who at last took pity on him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear Vogelstein, she&rsquo;s the latest freshest fruit
of our great American evolution.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the self-made
girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Otto gazed a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fruit of the great
American Revolution?&nbsp; Yes, Mrs. Steuben told me her
great-grandfather&mdash;&rdquo; but the rest of his sentence was
lost in a renewed explosion of Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s sense of
the ridiculous.&nbsp; He bravely pushed his advantage, such as it
was, however, and, desiring his host&rsquo;s definition to be
defined, inquired what the self-made girl might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and we&rsquo;ll tell you all about it,&rdquo;
Mrs. Bonnycastle said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like talking this way,
after a party&rsquo;s over.&nbsp; You can smoke if you like, and
Alfred will open another window.&nbsp; Well, to begin with, the
self-made girl&rsquo;s a new feature.&nbsp; That, however, you
know.&nbsp; In the second place she isn&rsquo;t self-made at
all.&nbsp; We all help to make her&mdash;we take such an interest
in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s only after she&rsquo;s made!&rdquo; Alfred
Bonnycastle broke in.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Vogelstein that
takes an interest.&nbsp; What on earth has started you up so on
the subject of Miss Day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The visitor explained as well as he could that it was merely
the accident of his having crossed the ocean in the steamer with
her; but he felt the inadequacy of this account of the matter,
felt it more than his hosts, who could know neither how little
actual contact he had had with her on the ship, how much he had
been affected by Mrs. Dangerfield&rsquo;s warnings, nor how much
observation at the same time he had lavished on her.&nbsp; He sat
there half an hour, and the warm dead stillness of the Washington
night&mdash;nowhere are the nights so silent&mdash;came in at the
open window, mingled with a soft sweet earthy smell, the smell of
growing things and in particular, as he thought, of Mrs.
Steuben&rsquo;s Sooth.&nbsp; Before he went away he had heard all
about the self-made girl, and there was something in the picture
that strongly impressed him.&nbsp; She was possible doubtless
only in America; American life had smoothed the way for
her.&nbsp; She was not fast, nor emancipated, nor crude, nor
loud, and there wasn&rsquo;t in her, of necessity at least, a
grain of the stuff of which the adventuress is made.&nbsp; She
was simply very successful, and her success was entirely
personal.&nbsp; She hadn&rsquo;t been born with the silver spoon
of social opportunity; she had grasped it by honest
exertion.&nbsp; You knew her by many different signs, but
chiefly, infallibly, by the appearance of her parents.&nbsp; It
was her parents who told her story; you always saw how little her
parents could have made her.&nbsp; Her attitude with regard to
them might vary in different ways.&nbsp; As the great fact on her
own side was that she had lifted herself from a lower social
plane, done it all herself, and done it by the simple lever of
her personality, it was naturally to be expected that she would
leave the authors of her mere material being in the shade.&nbsp;
Sometimes she had them in her wake, lost in the bubbles and the
foam that showed where she had passed; sometimes, as Alfred
Bonnycastle said, she let them slide altogether; sometimes she
kept them in close confinement, resorting to them under cover of
night and with every precaution; sometimes she exhibited them to
the public in discreet glimpses, in prearranged attitudes.&nbsp;
But the general characteristic of the self-made girl was that,
though it was frequently understood that she was privately
devoted to her kindred, she never attempted to impose them on
society, and it was striking that, though in some of her
manifestations a bore, she was at her worst less of a bore than
they.&nbsp; They were almost always solemn and portentous, and
they were for the most part of a deathly respectability.&nbsp;
She wasn&rsquo;t necessarily snobbish, unless it was snobbish to
want the best.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t cringe, she didn&rsquo;t
make herself smaller than she was; she took on the contrary a
stand of her own and attracted things to herself.&nbsp; Naturally
she was possible only in America&mdash;only in a country where
whole ranges of competition and comparison were absent.&nbsp; The
natural history of this interesting creature was at last
completely laid bare to the earnest stranger, who, as he sat
there in the animated stillness, with the fragrant breath of the
Western world in his nostrils, was convinced of what he had
already suspected, that conversation in the great Republic was
more yearningly, not to say gropingly, psychological than
elsewhere.&nbsp; Another thing, as he learned, that you knew the
self-made girl by was her culture, which was perhaps a little too
restless and obvious.&nbsp; She had usually got into society more
or less by reading, and her conversation was apt to be garnished
with literary allusions, even with familiar quotations.&nbsp;
Vogelstein hadn&rsquo;t had time to observe this element as a
developed form in Pandora Day; but Alfred Bonnycastle hinted that
he wouldn&rsquo;t trust her to keep it under in a
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>.&nbsp; It was needless to
say that these young persons had always been to Europe; that was
usually the first place they got to.&nbsp; By such arts they
sometimes entered society on the other side before they did so at
home; it was to be added at the same time that this resource was
less and less valuable, for Europe, in the American world, had
less and less prestige and people in the Western hemisphere now
kept a watch on that roundabout road.&nbsp; All of which quite
applied to Pandora Day&mdash;the journey to Europe, the culture
(as exemplified in the books she read on the ship), the
relegation, the effacement, of the family.&nbsp; The only thing
that was exceptional was the rapidity of her march; for the jump
she had taken since he left her in the hands of Mr. Lansing
struck Vogelstein, even after he had made all allowance for the
abnormal homogeneity of the American mass, as really
considerable.&nbsp; It took all her cleverness to account for
such things.&nbsp; When she &ldquo;moved&rdquo; from
Utica&mdash;mobilised her commissariat&mdash;the battle appeared
virtually to have been gained.</p>
<p>Count Otto called the next day, and Mrs. Steuben&rsquo;s
blackamoor informed him, in the communicative manner of his race,
that the ladies had gone out to pay some visits and look at the
Capitol.&nbsp; Pandora apparently had not hitherto examined this
monument, and our young man wished he had known, the evening
before, of her omission, so that he might have offered to be her
initiator.&nbsp; There is too obvious a connexion for us to fail
of catching it between his regret and the fact that in leaving
Mrs. Steuben&rsquo;s door he reminded himself that he wanted a
good walk, and that he thereupon took his way along Pennsylvania
Avenue.&nbsp; His walk had become fairly good by the time he
reached the great white edifice that unfolds its repeated
colonnades and uplifts its isolated dome at the end of a long
vista of saloons and tobacco-shops.&nbsp; He slowly climbed the
great steps, hesitating a little, even wondering why he had
come.&nbsp; The superficial reason was obvious enough, but there
was a real one behind it that struck him as rather wanting in the
solidity which should characterise the motives of an emissary of
Prince Bismarck.&nbsp; The superficial reason was a belief that
Mrs. Steuben would pay her visit first&mdash;it was probably only
a question of leaving cards&mdash;and bring her young friend to
the Capitol at the hour when the yellow afternoon light would
give a tone to the blankness of its marble walls.&nbsp; The
Capitol was a splendid building, but it was rather wanting in
tone.&nbsp; Vogelstein&rsquo;s curiosity about Pandora Day had
been much more quickened than checked by the revelations made to
him in Mrs. Bonnycastle&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; It was a
relief to have the creature classified; but he had a desire, of
which he had not been conscious before, to see really to the end
how well, in other words how completely and artistically, a girl
could make herself.&nbsp; His calculations had been just, and he
had wandered about the rotunda for only ten minutes, looking
again at the paintings, commemorative of the national annals,
which occupy its lower spaces, and at the simulated sculptures,
so touchingly characteristic of early American taste, which adorn
its upper reaches, when the charming women he had been counting
on presented themselves in charge of a licensed guide.&nbsp; He
went to meet them and didn&rsquo;t conceal from them that he had
marked them for his very own.&nbsp; The encounter was happy on
both sides, and he accompanied them through the queer and endless
interior, through labyrinths of bleak bare development, into
legislative and judicial halls.&nbsp; He thought it a hideous
place; he had seen it all before and asked himself what senseless
game he was playing.&nbsp; In the lower House were certain
bedaubed walls, in the basest style of imitation, which made him
feel faintly sick, not to speak of a lobby adorned with artless
prints and photographs of eminent defunct Congressmen that was
all too serious for a joke and too comic for a Valhalla.&nbsp;
But Pandora was greatly interested; she thought the Capitol very
fine; it was easy to criticise the details, but as a whole it was
the most impressive building she had ever seen.&nbsp; She proved
a charming fellow tourist; she had constantly something to say,
but never said it too much; it was impossible to drag in the wake
of a <i>cicerone</i> less of a lengthening or an irritating
chain.&nbsp; Vogelstein could see too that she wished to improve
her mind; she looked at the historical pictures, at the uncanny
statues of local worthies, presented by the different
States&mdash;they were of different sizes, as if they had been
&ldquo;numbered,&rdquo; in a shop&mdash;she asked questions of
the guide and in the chamber of the Senate requested him to show
her the chairs of the gentlemen from New York.&nbsp; She sat down
in one of them, though Mrs. Steuben told her <i>that</i> Senator
(she mistook the chair, dropping into another State) was a horrid
old thing.</p>
<p>Throughout the hour he spent with her Vogelstein seemed to see
how it was she had made herself.&nbsp; They walked about,
afterwards on the splendid terrace that surrounds the Capitol,
the great marble floor on which it stands, and made vague
remarks&mdash;Pandora&rsquo;s were the most definite&mdash;about
the yellow sheen of the Potomac, the hazy hills of Virginia, the
far-gleaming pediment of Arlington, the raw confused-looking
country.&nbsp; Washington was beneath them, bristling and
geometrical; the long lines of its avenues seemed to stretch into
national futures.&nbsp; Pandora asked Count Otto if he had ever
been to Athens and, on his admitting so much, sought to know
whether the eminence on which they stood didn&rsquo;t give him an
idea of the Acropolis in its prime.&nbsp; Vogelstein deferred the
satisfaction of this appeal to their next meeting; he was
glad&mdash;in spite of the appeal&mdash;to make pretexts for
seeing her again.&nbsp; He did so on the morrow; Mrs.
Steuben&rsquo;s picnic was still three days distant.&nbsp; He
called on Pandora a second time, also met her each evening in the
Washington world.&nbsp; It took very little of this to remind him
that he was forgetting both Mrs. Dangerfield&rsquo;s warnings and
the admonitions&mdash;long familiar to him&mdash;of his own
conscience.&nbsp; Was he in peril of love?&nbsp; Was he to be
sacrificed on the altar of the American girl, an altar at which
those other poor fellows had poured out some of the bluest blood
in Germany and he had himself taken oath he would never seriously
worship?&nbsp; He decided that he wasn&rsquo;t in real danger,
that he had rather clinched his precautions.&nbsp; It was true
that a young person who had succeeded so well for herself might
be a great help to her husband; but this diplomatic aspirant
preferred on the whole that his success should be his own: it
wouldn&rsquo;t please him to have the air of being pushed by his
wife.&nbsp; Such a wife as that would wish to push him, and he
could hardly admit to himself that this was what fate had in
reserve for him&mdash;to be propelled in his career by a young
lady who would perhaps attempt to talk to the Kaiser as he had
heard her the other night talk to the President.&nbsp; Would she
consent to discontinue relations with her family, or would she
wish still to borrow plastic relief from that domestic
background?&nbsp; That her family was so impossible was to a
certain extent an advantage; for if they had been a little better
the question of a rupture would be less easy.&nbsp; He turned
over these questions in spite of his security, or perhaps indeed
because of it.&nbsp; The security made them speculative and
disinterested.</p>
<p>They haunted him during the excursion to Mount Vernon, which
took place according to traditions long established.&nbsp; Mrs.
Steuben&rsquo;s confederates assembled on the steamer and were
set afloat on the big brown stream which had already seemed to
our special traveller to have too much bosom and too little
bank.&nbsp; Here and there, however, he became conscious of a
shore where there was something to look at, even though conscious
at the same time that he had of old lost great opportunities of
an idyllic cast in not having managed to be more &ldquo;thrown
with&rdquo; a certain young lady on the deck of the North German
Lloyd.&nbsp; The two turned round together to hang over
Alexandria, which for Pandora, as she declared, was a picture of
Old Virginia.&nbsp; She told Vogelstein that she was always
hearing about it during the Civil War, ages before.&nbsp; Little
girl as she had been at the time she remembered all the names
that were on people&rsquo;s lips during those years of
reiteration.&nbsp; This historic spot had a touch of the romance
of rich decay, a reference to older things, to a dramatic
past.&nbsp; The past of Alexandria appeared in the vista of three
or four short streets sloping up a hill and lined with poor brick
warehouses erected for merchandise that had ceased to come or
go.&nbsp; It looked hot and blank and sleepy, down to the shabby
waterside where tattered darkies dangled their bare feet from the
edge of rotting wharves.&nbsp; Pandora was even more interested
in Mount Vernon&mdash;when at last its wooded bluff began to
command the river&mdash;than she had been in the Capitol, and
after they had disembarked and ascended to the celebrated mansion
she insisted on going into every room it contained.&nbsp; She
&ldquo;claimed for it,&rdquo; as she said&mdash;some of her turns
were so characteristic both of her nationality and her own
style&mdash;the finest situation in the world, and was distinct
as to the shame of their not giving it to the President for his
country-seat.&nbsp; Most of her companions had seen the house
often, and were now coupling themselves in the grounds according
to their sympathies, so that it was easy for Vogelstein to offer
the benefit of his own experience to the most inquisitive member
of the party.&nbsp; They were not to lunch for another hour, and
in the interval the young man roamed with his first and fairest
acquaintance.&nbsp; The breath of the Potomac, on the boat, had
been a little harsh, but on the softly-curving lawn, beneath the
clustered trees, with the river relegated to a mere shining
presence far below and in the distance, the day gave out nothing
but its mildness, the whole scene became noble and genial.</p>
<p>Count Otto could joke a little on great occasions, and the
present one was worthy of his humour.&nbsp; He maintained to his
companion that the shallow painted mansion resembled a false
house, a &ldquo;wing&rdquo; or structure of daubed canvas, on the
stage; but she answered him so well with certain economical
palaces she had seen in Germany, where, as she said, there was
nothing but china stoves and stuffed birds, that he was obliged
to allow the home of Washington to be after all really
<i>gem&uuml;thlich</i>.&nbsp; What he found so in fact was the
soft texture of the day, his personal situation, the sweetness of
his suspense.&nbsp; For suspense had decidedly become his
portion; he was under a charm that made him feel he was watching
his own life and that his susceptibilities were beyond his
control.&nbsp; It hung over him that things might take a turn,
from one hour to the other, which would make them very different
from what they had been yet; and his heart certainly beat a
little faster as he wondered what that turn might be.&nbsp; Why
did he come to picnics on fragrant April days with American girls
who might lead him too far?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t such girls be
glad to marry a Pomeranian count?&nbsp; And <i>would</i> they,
after all, talk that way to the Kaiser?&nbsp; If he were to marry
one of them he should have to give her several thorough
lessons.</p>
<p>In their little tour of the house our young friend and his
companion had had a great many fellow visitors, who had also
arrived by the steamer and who had hitherto not left them an
ideal privacy.&nbsp; But the others gradually dispersed; they
circled about a kind of showman who was the authorised guide, a
big slow genial vulgar heavily-bearded man, with a whimsical
edifying patronising tone, a tone that had immense success when
he stopped here and there to make his points&mdash;to pass his
eyes over his listening flock, then fix them quite above it with
a meditative look and bring out some ancient pleasantry as if it
were a sudden inspiration.&nbsp; He made a cheerful thing, an
echo of the platform before the booth of a country fair, even of
a visit to the tomb of the <i>pater patri&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; It is
enshrined in a kind of grotto in the grounds, and Vogelstein
remarked to Pandora that he was a good man for the place, but was
too familiar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh he&rsquo;d have been familiar with
Washington,&rdquo; said the girl with the bright dryness with
which she often uttered amusing things.&nbsp; Vogelstein looked
at her a moment, and it came over him, as he smiled, that she
herself probably wouldn&rsquo;t have been abashed even by the
hero with whom history has taken fewest liberties.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You look as if you could hardly believe that,&rdquo;
Pandora went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You Germans are always in such awe
of great people.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it occurred to her critic that
perhaps after all Washington would have liked her manner, which
was wonderfully fresh and natural.&nbsp; The man with the beard
was an ideal minister to American shrines; he played on the
curiosity of his little band with the touch of a master, drawing
them at the right moment away to see the classic ice-house where
the old lady had been found weeping in the belief it was
Washington&rsquo;s grave.&nbsp; While this monument was under
inspection our interesting couple had the house to themselves,
and they spent some time on a pretty terrace where certain
windows of the second floor opened&mdash;a little rootless
verandah which overhung, in a manner, obliquely, all the
magnificence of the view; the immense sweep of the river, the
artistic plantations, the last-century garden with its big box
hedges and remains of old espaliers.&nbsp; They lingered here for
nearly half an hour, and it was in this retirement that
Vogelstein enjoyed the only approach to intimate conversation
appointed for him, as was to appear, with a young woman in whom
he had been unable to persuade himself that he was not
absorbed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not necessary, and it&rsquo;s not
possible, that I should reproduce this colloquy; but I may
mention that it began&mdash;as they leaned against the parapet of
the terrace and heard the cheerful voice of the showman wafted up
to them from a distance&mdash;with his saying to her rather
abruptly that he couldn&rsquo;t make out why they hadn&rsquo;t
had more talk together when they crossed the Atlantic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can if you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said
Pandora.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have talked quick enough if you
had spoken to me.&nbsp; I spoke to you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember that&rdquo;&mdash;and it affected him
awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You listened too much to Mrs. Dangerfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He feigned a vagueness.&nbsp; &ldquo;To Mrs.
Dangerfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That woman you were always sitting with; she told you
not to speak to me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen her in New York; she
speaks to me now herself.&nbsp; She recommended you to have
nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh how can you say such dreadful things?&rdquo; Count
Otto cried with a very becoming blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t deny it.&nbsp; You
weren&rsquo;t attracted by my family.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
charming people when you know them.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t have a
better time anywhere than I have at home,&rdquo; the girl went on
loyally.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what does it matter?&nbsp; My family
are very happy.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re getting quite used to New
York.&nbsp; Mrs. Dangerfield&rsquo;s a vulgar wretch&mdash;next
winter she&rsquo;ll call on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unlike any M&auml;dchen I&rsquo;ve ever
seen&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; said poor
Vogelstein with the colour still in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you never <i>will</i> understand
me&mdash;probably; but what difference does it make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He attempted to tell her what difference, but I&rsquo;ve no
space to follow him here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s known that when the
German mind attempts to explain things it doesn&rsquo;t always
reduce them to simplicity, and Pandora was first mystified, then
amused, by some of the Count&rsquo;s revelations.&nbsp; At last I
think she was a little frightened, for she remarked irrelevantly,
with some decision, that luncheon would be ready and that they
ought to join Mrs. Steuben.&nbsp; Her companion walked slowly, on
purpose, as they left the house together, for he knew the pang of
a vague sense that he was losing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you be in Washington many days yet?&rdquo; he
appealed as they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will all depend.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m expecting important
news.&nbsp; What I shall do will be influenced by
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way she talked about expecting news&mdash;and
important!&mdash;made him feel somehow that she had a career,
that she was active and independent, so that he could scarcely
hope to stop her as she passed.&nbsp; It was certainly true that
he had never seen any girl like her.&nbsp; It would have occurred
to him that the news she was expecting might have reference to
the favour she had begged of the President, if he hadn&rsquo;t
already made up his mind&mdash;in the calm of meditation after
that talk with the Bonnycastles&mdash;that this favour must be a
pleasantry.&nbsp; What she had said to him had a discouraging, a
somewhat chilling effect; nevertheless it was not without a
certain ardour that he inquired of her whether, so long as she
stayed in Washington, he mightn&rsquo;t pay her certain
respectful attentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you like&mdash;and as respectful ones; but
you won&rsquo;t keep them up for ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try to torment me,&rdquo; said Count Otto.</p>
<p>She waited to explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean that I may have
some of my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted to see them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she just hung fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some
you&rsquo;ve never seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the afternoon, returning to Washington on the steamer,
Vogelstein received a warning.&nbsp; It came from Mrs.
Bonnycastle and constituted, oddly enough, the second juncture at
which an officious female friend had, while sociably afloat with
him, advised him on the subject of Pandora Day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing we forgot to tell you the other
night about the self-made girl,&rdquo; said the lady of infinite
mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s never safe to fix your affections
on her, because she has almost always an impediment somewhere in
the background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her askance, but smiled and said: &ldquo;I should
understand your information&mdash;for which I&rsquo;m so much
obliged&mdash;a little better if I knew what you mean by an
impediment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I mean she&rsquo;s always engaged to some young man
who belongs to her earlier phase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her earlier phase?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time before she had made herself&mdash;when she
lived unconscious of her powers.&nbsp; A young man from Utica,
say.&nbsp; They usually have to wait; he&rsquo;s probably in a
store.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Otto somehow preferred to understand as little as
possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean a betrothal&mdash;to take
effect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean anything German and
moonstruck.&nbsp; I mean that piece of peculiarly American
enterprise a premature engagement&mdash;to take effect, but too
complacently, at the end of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein very properly reflected that it was no use his
having entered the diplomatic career if he weren&rsquo;t able to
bear himself as if this interesting generalisation had no
particular message for him.&nbsp; He did Mrs. Bonnycastle
moreover the justice to believe that she wouldn&rsquo;t have
approached the question with such levity if she had supposed she
should make him wince.&nbsp; The whole thing was, like everything
else, but for her to laugh at, and the betrayal moreover of a
good intention.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see, I see&mdash;the self-made
girl has of course always had a past.&nbsp; Yes, and the young
man in the store&mdash;from Utica&mdash;is part of her
past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You express it perfectly,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Bonnycastle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say it better
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But with her present, with her future, when they change
like this young lady&rsquo;s, I suppose everything else
changes.&nbsp; How do you say it in America?&nbsp; She lets him
slide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t say it at all!&rdquo; Mrs. Bonnycastle
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;She does nothing of the sort; for what do you
take her?&nbsp; She sticks to him; that at least is what we
<i>expect</i> her to do,&rdquo; she added with less
assurance.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I tell you, the type&rsquo;s new and
the case under consideration.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t yet had time
for complete study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh of course I hope she sticks to him,&rdquo;
Vogelstein declared simply and with his German accent more
audible, as it always was when he was slightly agitated.</p>
<p>For the rest of the trip he was rather restless.&nbsp; He
wandered about the boat, talking little with the returning
picnickers.&nbsp; Toward the last, as they drew near Washington
and the white dome of the Capitol hung aloft before them, looking
as simple as a suspended snowball, he found himself, on the deck,
in proximity to Mrs. Steuben.&nbsp; He reproached himself with
having rather neglected her during an entertainment for which he
was indebted to her bounty, and he sought to repair his omission
by a proper deference.&nbsp; But the only act of homage that
occurred to him was to ask her as by chance whether Miss Day
were, to her knowledge, engaged.</p>
<p>Mrs. Steuben turned her Southern eyes upon him with a look of
almost romantic compassion.&nbsp; &ldquo;To my knowledge?&nbsp;
Why of course I&rsquo;d know!&nbsp; I should think you&rsquo;d
know too.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t you know she was engaged?&nbsp; Why
she has been engaged since she was sixteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Count Otto gazed at the dome of the Capitol.&nbsp; &ldquo;To a
gentleman from Utica?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a native of her place.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s expecting
him soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so very glad to hear it,&rdquo; said
Vogelstein, who decidedly, for his career, had promise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And is she going to marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why what do people fall in love with each other
<i>for</i>?&nbsp; I presume they&rsquo;ll marry when she gets
round to it.&nbsp; Ah if she had only been from the
Sooth&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this he broke quickly in: &ldquo;But why have they never
brought it off, as you say, in so many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, at first she was too young, and then she thought
her family ought to see Europe&mdash;of course they could see it
better <i>with</i> her&mdash;and they spent some time
there.&nbsp; And then Mr. Bellamy had some business difficulties
that made him feel as if he didn&rsquo;t want to marry just
then.&nbsp; But he has given up business and I presume feels more
free.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s rather long, but all the while
they&rsquo;ve been engaged.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a true, true
love,&rdquo; said Mrs. Steuben, whose sound of the adjective was
that of a feeble flute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is his name Mr. Bellamy?&rdquo; the Count asked with
his haunting reminiscence.&nbsp; &ldquo;D. F. Bellamy, so?&nbsp;
And has he been in a store?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what kind of business it was: it was
some kind of business in Utica.&nbsp; I think he had a branch in
New York.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one of the leading gentlemen of Utica
and very highly educated.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good deal older than
Miss Day.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a very fine man&mdash;I presume a
college man.&nbsp; He stands very high in Utica.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know why you look as if you doubted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vogelstein assured Mrs. Steuben that he doubted nothing, and
indeed what she told him was probably the more credible for
seeming to him eminently strange.&nbsp; Bellamy had been the name
of the gentleman who, a year and a half before, was to have met
Pandora on the arrival of the German steamer; it was in
Bellamy&rsquo;s name that she had addressed herself with such
effusion to Bellamy&rsquo;s friend, the man in the straw hat who
was about to fumble in her mother&rsquo;s old clothes.&nbsp; This
was a fact that seemed to Count Otto to finish the picture of her
contradictions; it wanted at present no touch to be
complete.&nbsp; Yet even as it hung there before him it continued
to fascinate him, and he stared at it, detached from surrounding
things and feeling a little as if he had been pitched out of an
overturned vehicle, till the boat bumped against one of the
outstanding piles of the wharf at which Mrs. Steuben&rsquo;s
party was to disembark.&nbsp; There was some delay in getting the
steamer adjusted to the dock, during which the passengers watched
the process over its side and extracted what entertainment they
might from the appearance of the various persons collected to
receive it.&nbsp; There were darkies and loafers and hackmen, and
also vague individuals, the loosest and blankest he had ever seen
anywhere, with tufts on their chins, toothpicks in their mouths,
hands in their pockets, rumination in their jaws and diamond pins
in their shirt-fronts, who looked as if they had sauntered over
from Pennsylvania Avenue to while away half an hour, forsaking
for that interval their various slanting postures in the
porticoes of the hotels and the doorways of the saloons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh I&rsquo;m so glad!&nbsp; How sweet of you to come
down!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was a voice close to Count Otto&rsquo;s
shoulder that spoke these words, and he had no need to turn to
see from whom it proceeded.&nbsp; It had been in his ears the
greater part of the day, though, as he now perceived, without the
fullest richness of expression of which it was capable.&nbsp;
Still less was he obliged to turn to discover to whom it was
addressed, for the few simple words I have quoted had been flung
across the narrowing interval of water, and a gentleman who had
stepped to the edge of the dock without our young man&rsquo;s
observing him tossed back an immediate reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got here by the three o&rsquo;clock train.&nbsp; They
told me in K Street where you were, and I thought I&rsquo;d come
down and meet you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charming attention!&rdquo; said Pandora Day with the
laugh that seemed always to invite the whole of any company to
partake in it; though for some moments after this she and her
interlocutor appeared to continue the conversation only with
their eyes.&nbsp; Meanwhile Vogelstein&rsquo;s also were not
idle.&nbsp; He looked at her visitor from head to foot, and he
was aware that she was quite unconscious of his own
proximity.&nbsp; The gentleman before him was tall, good-looking,
well-dressed; evidently he would stand well not only at Utica,
but, judging from the way he had planted himself on the dock, in
any position that circumstances might compel him to take
up.&nbsp; He was about forty years old; he had a black moustache
and he seemed to look at the world over some counter-like expanse
on which he invited it all warily and pleasantly to put down
first its idea of the terms of a transaction.&nbsp; He waved a
gloved hand at Pandora as if, when she exclaimed &ldquo;Gracious,
ain&rsquo;t they long!&rdquo; to urge her to be patient.&nbsp;
She was patient several seconds and then asked him if he had any
news.&nbsp; He looked at her briefly, in silence, smiling, after
which he drew from his pocket a large letter with an
official-looking seal and shook it jocosely above his head.&nbsp;
This was discreetly, covertly done.&nbsp; No one but our young
man appeared aware of how much was taking place&mdash;and poor
Count Otto mainly felt it in the air.&nbsp; The boat was touching
the wharf and the space between the pair inconsiderable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Department of State?&rdquo; Pandora very prettily and
soundlessly mouthed across at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your opinion of the Dutch?&rdquo; the
gentleman asked for answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh gracious!&rdquo; cried Pandora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, are you going to wait for the return trip?&rdquo;
said the gentleman.</p>
<p>Our silent sufferer turned away, and presently Mrs. Steuben
and her companion disembarked together.&nbsp; When this lady
entered a carriage with Miss Day the gentleman who had spoken to
the girl followed them; the others scattered, and Vogelstein,
declining with thanks a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; from Mrs. Bonnycastle,
walked home alone and in some intensity of meditation.&nbsp; Two
days later he saw in a newspaper an announcement that the
President had offered the post of Minister to Holland to Mr. D.
F. Bellamy of Utica; and in the course of a month he heard from
Mrs. Steuben that Pandora, a thousand other duties performed, had
finally &ldquo;got round&rdquo; to the altar of her own
nuptials.&nbsp; He communicated this news to Mrs. Bonnycastle,
who had not heard it but who, shrieking at the queer face he
showed her, met it with the remark that there was now ground for
a new induction as to the self-made girl.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
