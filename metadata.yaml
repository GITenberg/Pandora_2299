description: It has long been the custom of the North German Lloyd steamers, which
  convey passengers from Bremen to New York, to anchor for several hours in the pleasant
  port of Southampton, where their human cargo receives many additions. An intelligent
  young German, Count Otto Vogelstein, hardly knew a few years ago whether to condemn
  this custom or approve it. He leaned over the bulwarks of the Donau as the American
  passengers crossed the plank - the travellers who embark at Southampton are mainly
  of that nationality - and curiously, indifferently, vaguely, through the smoke of
  his cigar, saw them absorbed in the huge capacity of the ship, where he had the
  agreeable consciousness that his own nest was comfortably made.
